You know that what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a child, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather luck, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell into you.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated cycle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, at the middle school, <unk> <unk> where I was the rare class.
When I went down to bleed every week at the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the early years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm aware that of adults never got to know us.
You could put it to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to ask you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the take of it, and we got away from her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
The <unk> to me about 60 feet -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think this was a <unk> of <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they come out of the glaciers or the <unk>
Each iceberg has its own personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to <unk> and hold up to the end, while others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that they're isolated and alone, as well as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts it releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it would be about the portraits.
It's not death when you get <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent actually going to actually witness an <unk> iceberg here.
You have it.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> from water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so the <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much on the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception of conception -- I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in an case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of the sperm joins the X chromosome.
They both <unk> and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my ground activity I will find two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how you consider the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have they thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical typology is not fits in male and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the common forms of male or female.
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that became <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles are making testosterone.
But given that this individual consists of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of <unk> to the <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops in a typically <unk> course.
When you get the baby out of it, the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, as men, have in the body called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a woman <unk> does not know the <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the brain that is more exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> that has the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing -- it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a <unk> <unk> <unk> and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and he had just discovered that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had 20th chromosomes and the <unk> the <unk> glands were so active -- which essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the <unk> were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk>
And it went to the 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why it happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an identity <unk> <unk> to be black, it means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very powerful ideas in our culture to <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is having kids that are born like two people inside one body.
The highest case is last year of the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in the judgment of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called asking, "What test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we were thinking of very stable <unk> categories that will <unk> directly with clinical categories -- they're much more <unk> than <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
In terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you say?
And as we go into science and more and more <unk> in which we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> probably is too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know inside the <unk> to when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of it was going to put a pen in front of the nose and if it moved on still not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract a vital organs of a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of really understanding of somebody's death, and that puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, the people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
And so I think these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about it.
It will take us from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the fathers -- <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each of you so much watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the parents <unk>
The parents were finished, the first activists of the anatomy and I tell you why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept -- and it <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And like all of you remember, what our parents were, the <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they were clear the idea of the right of the birth of a birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the right of the blood of the grandfather passed the father and then the son, etc.
The parents would have rejected that idea and replaced by a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were getting two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the parents, <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> of the rational explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed by a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of a <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Cairo, you talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement and said, "I'm a man."
Again, people in the color that are going to be able to give the <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we hold certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some divisions <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five people were supposed to allow kids to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before he time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, Henry, actually, in term: <unk> was born July March 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry the right -- sexual consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born afterwards.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on his hand, he doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry all the states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science was so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people got stuck in a strange position.
For instance, Texas at a time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have a chromosome -- and you have to marry a woman you have to have the Y.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests of the people.
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you at the beginning of the syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> speech, <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks great.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we had to take it on this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more the social services that some humans I know.
I also want to say that perhaps some <unk> that I know can be able to make more intelligent and <unk> decisions about their sex relationships than I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content on the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to keep this current thinking of thinking about the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed, unless it's willing to favor a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give birth <unk> to then pick them apart and then <unk> their name.
But when the phone asked her the <unk> he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum instead of the separation of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end up I want to say I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more involvement to <unk>
And I want to say something a bit of radical <unk> and I think that there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> -- particularly if there are people thinking in a group.
Since years ago, because I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about his question, the more I think there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male who makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very excited about finding the way to protect people because of the state, it's possible to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when you get democracy beyond the way, think less about the individual body in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we tried to create a more perfect date, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, it has a chance to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily go into the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just by building buildings from apartments.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartment already were owners and then the other half is still not not not to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all of the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around have rules to avoid the <unk> and the autism of the construction construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, and you could build a completely new, new apartment building, always and when the rules of that <unk> place to build it.
And so I suggested that governments were going to have new reform areas to contain cities, and I gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk> Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent would come up from his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the following presidential elections, <unk> <unk> came up with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> he was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, as those rules that say that you can't go and hide to all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like the rules for <unk> and usually are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link with the <unk>
I showed you to <unk>
They called me.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about valuable things that are the cities, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is moving forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk again about four and <unk>
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that for a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained to the <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government -- they would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with the associated countries that help them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all be confident that they were effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily deal with a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> its Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow us to create these special development regions of development.
In a country that was just going through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the Congress for this constitutional constitutional constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the parties, all the controls in society, the <unk>
To <unk> the Constitution has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over again in another voting in <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in 21 to 24 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center of the city that is building in North Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they are already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to understand, and then it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing her to allow her Supreme Court to be the last court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are lots of companies that wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents that have to leave back to their family to get a job, sometimes they are mothers who have to win money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, there are sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friend <unk> was asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession to public confession to me -- and I live alive obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and most recently, photographing and post on my blog and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I'm going to like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we're going to do, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you get to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I got.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
I turned inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else I wanted to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks by TED in inner underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the data for this week.
It doesn't sound <unk>
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons that I believe that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call it tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get rid of you, you will also get stuck.
<unk> <unk> of the kid that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to play the <unk> or I remind you to their <unk> <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and the outside, you don't have to be <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and only one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it again and again when people were approaching me this week just so I was using it, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it to a whole thing.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we need to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and I'm up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So, if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be safe and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need pretty much logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We have to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and she didn't do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet you play with that bar in a parking lot I showed you a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a huge conceptual model that you can have the world, except you be a physical physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars -- they play with these strange little particles.
And when you play with your particles, they find that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years, you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, never nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well into my logical side.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why he should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see it's been in a measure of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal piece with a springboard and a springboard and <unk> supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a way of swimming <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum object, but for it it needs a little help.
Let me do an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator -- I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want them, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to throw all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put out the lights -- then we put a <unk> and pulled all the air, and we pulled it down to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as it wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way it was to <unk> it was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, thrust, we were able to make them <unk> and that didn't fit at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean to be a <unk> thing, and you don't go to the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal is still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
The rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on the scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how do that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we zoom in, and we lit the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there on one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all objects on the elevator in fact, are actually just quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics you hear that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was working on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and that allowed me to do that.
It took me 18 months and so on.
A lot of negotiations and stories, it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story is explaining just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go museums, and I began to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the wish to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you a demo for then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've made from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery <unk> the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorites, to <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the flat plane and, with one click, we click inside.
You're inside, that you want to go to the end of the hall,
Let's go ahead. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all information about <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, -- I think, about 10,000 million pixel power.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get to do with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see funny things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started play, and I found myself with something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks like <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is actually a <unk> with a stick on the <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper into deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we go quickly to jump over again in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this work <unk>
It goes up and truth and truth that we will.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to do it."
This is the really cool thing. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just got a zoom in.
It's about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel when you feel about these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even though they come from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to its artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question you do today is: "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> an pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian all the children in Italy are growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it's happened something very interesting about the racing War in the last two decades.
So some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I took a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what we have in engineering, it will take control system control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities over the last few years, have been covered in networks and <unk>
They're turning computers into the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> <unk> in MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms they were going to get to sensors and <unk>
And that's constantly changing the interaction that as human beings have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end, I took the hammer off, and he threw it back to the Moses -- you can actually see a little bit of a dent in <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in <unk> 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
And in the late afternoon, there are people over here and there doing <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
He earns in Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the British team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the age -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but of things we use and consume it.
Today we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags that we can track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one label on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that before it didn't exist.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think of is that if you look at every day that the cup we dropped doesn't exist, which is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped a day still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came to us and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was imagine that you have a <unk> and you have a <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> which opens up and <unk>
It creates like a climb of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, show patterns, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can go through the image.
We introduced this to Mayor <unk>
He liked a lot.
And we had a commission to design the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows or windows, but when you come up with it it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the ceiling.
Or you can close the building, and the whole architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be someone in the winter, when the roof, go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they do it, but when it's low almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it's working.
You see the people <unk> so it goes on inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be trying to prove the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night it was really much more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact with it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go back, but a building that was still making <unk> and water holes and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people to use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and from projections over them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little little <unk> in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in <unk>
We could form this cloud,
So sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal but in three dimensions, where what it changes is the light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can reach, and you go back and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best twin dancers today, the star from New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D in real time as a motion capture.
It can make the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a farm farm like breeding <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them a little bit about a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign would be able to go through the digital world, the power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How will it go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together in collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the same.
It's a physical structure in London, but the pixel cover.
You can move around it, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the London Olympics.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new <unk>
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you'd like to be in better way, be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure for themselves?
How about living more <unk>
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are I going to do more <unk>
What do you like if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people will love creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many people want the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great 20th century of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which is also <unk> in the <unk> Church -- he wrote a trial called <unk> <unk> it makes sense of the light of the <unk>
But if we effectively take biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look to the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right at one point is, of course, the most interested in.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
In the course you've been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk>
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, <unk> which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the most bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> tells you the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautiful environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark. It's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to want no effort from their part.
It's really like a quick pathway to bacteria with a occasional <unk> disruption of the <unk>
But, of course, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what will the future?
We're in sort of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only <unk> and the human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two little daughters.
But when organisms come in, things start to change.
The sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the human body enters evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> death <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was going on, every year I was happening, every time I had more doubt.
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90s.
And one night someone hits your hotel door to your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous <unk> dancer clothes.
He looks at him and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think that all of us would <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily necessarily help longevity.
It doesn't necessarily harm the largest or the louder or even more quickly and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only working of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, they would be <unk> to the <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look ahead, at the stage, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the reasoning underlying that would be that through medicine, in the first place, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and taken from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, by the way, <unk> <unk> and we have so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of human type, naturally dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of the evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we get older, when we sort of <unk> the distant planets going to exist, and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing and intriguing possibility and terrifying possibility of it.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what is informed for individual and familiar.
Just think that if it could possibly be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in its own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, and she sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three and four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
Not much of it to make the human genome actually to be made by <unk> and getting more and more the scope of all.
So these changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin on bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect us from themselves, but they are going to be <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course with the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cells from an tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> egg, and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate your diabetes, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also allow us to have <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could have the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions that are going to look at the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can put it to 1,000 years and maybe in the next 100 years.
These are elections.
We're going to use these choices to a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, let's choose different attributes we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing of all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall away.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about the flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot would take the airplane on the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
It flies the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to come and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I was thinking about that, more ahead, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll set it up.
I don't want to focus on anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the <unk> the bridge George Washington was not very much -- I thought -- Whoa! I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my errors have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also took place to my ego.
And I am sorry that I was going to focus on things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to be <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, I'll die not a fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small guy.
And for me, that was all the reason to be in the world.
And at that point I realized when I connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and live differently.
You are flying up today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you get it?
What is it that we need to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents than <unk>
Thank you.
I've been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after he walked and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, <unk> has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you have seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are communicating with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how it was going to be <unk>
And I was obsessed with his brother and his father in that particular moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to speak, we will build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inner can't afford it.
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer about that and record the negative space.
So they're going around by making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle of life.
They first start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another we had a couple of things.
One is to touch the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine to be able to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't do it. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers around the world from all the <unk> of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and the kids and I moved to the garage in the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken out the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went out to the <unk> of <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a pair of cheap Sun <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things from Home <unk> and <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it together on a LED light and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds one itself, we published the <unk> code, the software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So, at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after about a year of planning, two weeks of computer programming all the night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the outside parking wall out of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends, and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time it drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to <unk> and she would get me out of there so that I could be able to <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through with this.
It's a cool device, but this is the equivalent of an <unk> Blank.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to fix it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the <unk> <unk> of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in <unk> <unk> in downtown Los Angeles there will be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of the things in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with technology recognition technology -- I just recognized something, and I would tell you with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like we have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who is who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time a both dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days eating this thing -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career I've been <unk> in situations in the very awful appearance with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that <unk> <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that they look entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk from 2011.
What had been this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to the content I could go through in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous for you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to go.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would never have been able to marry certain.
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I have been involved in situations in the last few years, but nothing could be allowed to do it for something that was so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I try to do a product of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is driven by product products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever -- is that all of the top up at the bottom, from beginning to end, has images of brand, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? <unk> It's <unk> To <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure we will make sure it will give all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we put a shoe and become the most great shoe you have to do.
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film would ever be <unk> the best drink that you've got <unk> from "The largest film ever ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The whole goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the full idea, all the shot from beginning to end.
And I would love to help you help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's a funny one, it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people at all.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to be <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money does this need to do this?
MS: One million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meet them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big brand.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the film is going to look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be I?
JK: That's both things.
MS: ... means you're not really optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that I was going to have a <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle that's worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images from <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were just showing you.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really change something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> -- like that rare bear, which is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They had a whole bowl of pretzels from <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want to take a story, but you want to be <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and that's him staring at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in history.
It's your story, there is my story, and it's history <unk>
As you see, in this filmed we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take my way out and go to companies myself with my whole team.
So what I started to see is all of a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make a big film, huge giants and others that make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful because of the brands of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make films they say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The greatest <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the film?
Every time I get out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little bit nervous.
I want to help you that you want.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man to be able to <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general story.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand small.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people to be the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: democracy.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think it's a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we hold fresh time? With better <unk> more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: It will be my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the 1980s, the 1980s, unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: And I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, so many gray things.
Usually I'm wearing opposing sunglasses, or like the <unk> and the same thing.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Part of the <unk> <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: am the kind of the pets.
It creates toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
5: 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to be brand Tom, but I often hit the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: telling me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way it is.
MS: These are a way to shape the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think that your world is the world in which we think about the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case come from and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who wanted to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me for me to do that?
What's the <unk> What phase you find is you find you now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You know, you don't have to be afraid of what kind of mountain Russian is you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality personality, the <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They got very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only lie in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's nature's nature to avoid the things that are not trying to avoid fear -- those items, and you actually <unk> them and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful markings and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to give you your own identity, your personality personality -- what would that be?
Are you a <unk> attribute -- you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> attribute <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be beautiful, and <unk> <unk> and bold or bold as <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic as a <unk>
Or are you more than attribute <unk>
Are you aware, sophisticated <unk>
Are you <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> you <unk> with <unk>
You're a <unk> stable, family -- safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we can now use MRI MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where they are forbidden the advertising in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting on the way on the schools with the money problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects I have had the greatest answer or that I've been most successful at the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how have he gone? <unk>
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk>
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This takes just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to make lead.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talked about, to their customers will not be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks if you take risks that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss -- at risk is preparing their company for <unk> by rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give it the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So let's put it on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: Is this a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix at TED, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my own next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> are from completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
So I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> had multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes.
That was called the attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they went very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a <unk> rat didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it is actually working on that one.
If you don't, you don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, an energy plant plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we discovered that it was <unk> in two bomb bombs -- a small and big.
We also saw that they were armed with very <unk> people who obviously had any internal information.
They are going to make all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much they were <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me say, the burden is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks quite like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to match it with the real world with potential real real world.
We need theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to the theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
There are no several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants among our <unk>
I called them and I saw them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate this little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that moving part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers. So you couldn't solve this very quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> out in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started to research scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it became better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A very <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> dead ends.
Even so, we discovered that both digital <unk> would look at one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals to be <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really showed me.
There's the gray box and the top is the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values for example, with pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and they provide <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant when the big steam turbine is going through speed, you need to open tubes of escape in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do this a human operator, of course.
That's where we need digital security.
And when you're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have to be able to disseminate that load with a key key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be as possible.
And if you did that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we should face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces in a lot of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and we need to deal with the implications, and we need to be able to prepare ourselves now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk>
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to lead and give them a <unk> skills, or another thing that makes users of wheelchair users go up and get back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
There are nothing different than you put in the morning, it gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and aid, for example, how to manage balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other magnificent things <unk>
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier which, on average, has to take over your back, a charge of 45 pounds, and it's being allowed to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton to <unk> I can take it up 90 pounds by land for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then raise my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device -- this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back now look at the users of wheelchair and the wheels, what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people here in wheelchair chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often very young people, with damage to the column that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> quickly.
Its only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been in the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19 years ago had an injury in the spinal column, and as a result couldn't go back to walk for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that we <unk>
It's got some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals on board on board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries that give you energy to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and make it move forward with this very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a stranger in the air air, skiing down the bottom air, she was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of a feeling and all the motion of shattered down.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You will never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last ounce of hope from my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just by soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of the <unk> to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where play is serious.
And no, it's not the refugee of Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
<unk> are along with the chimps, their closest closest relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been taken for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> trade and deforestation is making you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are left in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden off the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we know them like apes, <unk> love, not because they have sex -- <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a children's play.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo you see the root roots same of laughter -- the dance and the human ritual and the human eye.
The game is the glue that brings us together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I don't speak football game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing involved elements to play -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and explore the limits of our inner and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But <unk> our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems less appropriate to play, they can be the moments that is the most <unk>
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as they care about creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, you see fires as a captain of the captain of the <unk> in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are fooled by highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in complete night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I was, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked her to fit and would save the owner of his <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a live living only because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and she brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hallway went to the firemen <unk> that at the age of <unk> and he went into the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back down the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog at the front door.
<unk> from the house calls for home <unk> where, as she was expected, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from his home <unk> by the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteers to volunteer was a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage and courage acts of the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So, when I look at this room of people who have succeeded, or are we doing remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give me <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
I'm mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea of a fixed sense of cement in a fixed measure that fits with each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit of construction construction in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, as buildings or buildings, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 billion per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings, or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
It simply adopted the block of concrete, the <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block of concrete, the transistor allows to create much greater and more complex circuits a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they link through magnets.
So you can't place it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the pink is the stream, and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
A blue with one blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make <unk> faster or slower, you just spin this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to become <unk> to use it.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light night, or why the door of an elevator is keeping it open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience start playing with <unk> as a material.
You can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago we took a few weeks ago to the School School School of Rhode Island <unk> who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, "Let's do something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk> turned on motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the dark.
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small company is seeking to engage in the environment to focus on the environment.
<unk> <unk>
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm just <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents most of what we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of giving them to the Third World We send them to the wild world <unk>
They made big <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> from the city of Boston.
This is like if I would find a quote, but what really looks for is that someone will clean up when it is caught by snow, because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did they get to ask for help this way <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something more thing: than citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You keep <unk> when you <unk>
And when you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads into viral form.
An app of the city of <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for citizens to make <unk>
It's very important to work with these tsunami, but people would <unk>
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that we need to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in a natural way.
If you know a bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't normally happen.
<unk> acquisition of software takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to be able to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had been made by the normal canals and it would have taken at least two and 50 million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project at the court of California that at the time it has 50 billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
And so an app that shows you in a couple of days, and it spreads on viral shape is a kind of <unk> shot from the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think that should be.
It's not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools so that we are putting together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration for that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know what we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us talk about, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because we alone don't survive.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made up of us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> -- how to think about it will affect the way that it will produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to get <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly a matter of <unk>
This is the center of <unk> and information center.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined the bottom of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music right and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
I don't have that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up in, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the government for government <unk>
But it's also a big example of government as a platform.
And I'm not necessarily talking about the definition of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, one citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
I connected to the two people.
And I could have made them connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When neighbor neighbor helps another neighbor <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a political <unk> Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope the government will evolve our values and our own needs, then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
Typically, what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps it out of the fact that we have the fact that we funded as something that operates in our against.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy in sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
Have you <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed set of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us that we've been testing in front of government, it's time to ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will be able to go and solve the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't eat government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology can be possible to root the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> just to make the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old as I am, to <unk> I'm a major generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't care about to do hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They get into the work to program applications that make applications better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be washing out a <unk> by taking out <unk> dumping a garbage cube into a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, not only is we not only the government consumers we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of the people, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED seeing and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning in it.
A doctor can do things good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in my family.
She <unk> many of them in our home.
It was daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia and <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at it, she came up and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I returned to <unk> and I said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if he said it doesn't, I went back again and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went out of the room, and he said, "Come on my hand, and he said, "Come on. We'll get the two of us going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
She took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't know it. I said, "Sure."
And then he sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give you three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
He said, "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always be going to be the right thing to do, but the right thing to be <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in <unk> I have a brother over a year and a sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took my sister and me and we went for the forest.
We barely got to do the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered him to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. You <unk> But I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I went up with the force with force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that they're <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking that it's a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe we can do.
I think my grandmother thought that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 billion dollars.
In the United States we have the largest <unk> rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black holes between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in parole.
In urban <unk> The entire country, Los Angeles and UMBC, -- UMBC, 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what it affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not a problem with us.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work, some quite curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights whenever you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of male male population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it over to the next 10 years, the level of the loss of rights will be as high as it was before it <unk> law of the right to <unk>
We have this awesome silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he was in <unk> children to die in prison.
We have in this country prison country for kids, without a chance to come out.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they have taught us that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have been identified -- one which is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death corridor of death.
An innocent rate, was an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
So in aviation it may not allow you to fly airplanes if in every single nine that would be <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted for World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are people who are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you think, says, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our own history of the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the <unk> and decades of getting to race and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had a few other time.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about creativity, I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's really good to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> It's not death row in Germany.
<unk> we will never have to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, intentional and <unk> we could put people to run people.
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't do it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. We have creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are driven by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
lately talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more engagement, the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the ones who never get to TED.
And thinking about it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
And with innovation, with creativity -- it's not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from <unk> ideas as well as the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us not only in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities as TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect with the technology and design, that allowed us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to express inequality, for injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women would just gather to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say to me, <unk> comes the lady. <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
And so she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I went and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, let me tell you that it's that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in social justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got his finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to face these challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves by our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual and rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not by the way they treat rich and powerful <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in what's not it?
The judge was an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late in my own, by God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, must have magic <unk>
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a tiny, poor, black poor, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated like a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only was the <unk> but I had sent it to the court.
For about two months, I had forgotten it.
And then finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And I finally went down in the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black black man, was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I told him yes.
So I approached it, and I was hooked.
And I would tell you in our ear, in the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And we started myself."
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the policemen are <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how, the room was full of people. All right, because we talked about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I was going to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I looked through the window, and I would start hearing all that <unk>
So let me walk up here and for there.
Finally, this old black man, with <unk> face went into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was <unk> a <unk>
During the break of the <unk> he was showed because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant over the old black <unk>
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young woman to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up towards justice.
That we can't truly be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is tied to each other.
That our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people in this room who share this, I just want to tell you that keep sight of the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's a number of opportunities for you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to do an effort to <unk> the funds they are spending today in doing today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases don't <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes do nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds these funds to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's said that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes of violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why it comes up this dramatic increase in population <unk>
And we let us convince you for the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the chain <unk> to steal a bicycle, through small crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've really excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us, the first stop to survive, the first stop all that data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories we would look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices are given us negative news to give us negative news for seven days, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world will be wrong in worse.
But maybe not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the species, of the species, the shortage of water and <unk> certainly we have.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just ended with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita income is <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy has spent 25 percent more than 80 percent of the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water, no <unk> <unk> mobile, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of <unk>
We have a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we can put in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law is actually doubling at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to take two things on this curve.
First of all, how soft it is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in recession on depression and <unk>
It's the end of computer computers used to build a faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we think today.
<unk> computation in the cloud, which my friends in <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, and 3D printing and its ability to democratize and the ability to democratize personalized production on the planet, synthetic biology, and the food medicine and the <unk> the digital biology, the <unk> and the <unk> the digital biology, the <unk> and the <unk> the digital biology, the <unk> and the <unk> the digital biology,
I mean, how many saw the victory at "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I went out and I went through the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to every cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can actually impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, it would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a companies that you've already done before.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each single <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that right and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a middle-class story in the middle of the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The Napoleon troops ate with covered with silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
For that reason, the end of the Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal number.
It's bound by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum something so cheap we used it as if it was <unk>
It will make this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is built by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They go to the Earth 16 <unk> every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study showing that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. <unk> in the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we have plenty of water.
Let's talk about the wars now.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
<unk> a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, and two percent is ice, and <unk> by the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
Does the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave you permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small talent.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to a day of any source of water, saltwater, water, <unk> <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have confidence that I would be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications that President Reagan took 25 years ago.
And to count with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one might have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video books -- images, libraries of books and music, diagnostic technology -- now they have <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing will get to you when the applications are going to be in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with which they speak, and because you have <unk> you can get <unk> you can get their blood out of your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are health health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that you don't want to call the <unk> and first of all, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just been going through the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been before the global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you do? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D prints and computing in the cloud they'll be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
How about some voices never <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
So what are these <unk>
And if they are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X Prize is that small teams for their passion with an objective of course, they can do things that could only do things that were before the big corporations could do and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played this with this university professors, in each other.
And then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it has been shown today that the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to be able to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are focused on to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I'll just give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You might believe it <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it very much to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red List of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 meters, the black beard, were black.
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going on for a good moment, so it was made over the average in Ghana.
When we went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five inches.
It makes a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s lab, he started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose the countries that had already 100 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the National Sea Sea, and above all, on the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture that was something <unk>
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are small spots -- tiny little about <unk> remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came on the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary, because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom line of being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living one.
He was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
We don't remember it.
<unk> the point of starting to a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things <unk> biodiversity, lots of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end of a <unk> <unk>
And that, in large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they are no longer than they were gone.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before it's <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in an synonymous sea of large fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
And the time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect to have the evidence of evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them would like a few <unk> as a captain of such as a lot of fish in this area can't be used -- or usually they don't use the scientists from the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that it can make a protected area.
Because with the protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been run up and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected protected zone and they can benefit from the vision that they can do, which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, as the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think the arts and film might probably fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the harbor Bay, 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do they <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron, to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are doing viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed to be a very, very difficult thing.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, they come up with that in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can have done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They run over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of those, it becomes a myriad of lots and lots of visits to a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was actually 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of popular summer.
<unk> I didn't mention making a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
Was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would give you a video to the popular.
<unk> trends like Jimmy <unk> we have new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants me to come in the end of a week, the weekend.                                 <unk> will not be able to have this conversation without
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> it's also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday day.
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators will embrace a <unk> and share it with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> <unk> of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an infrared animation with an <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that is weird, you know that there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
So far, you saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then it became international made.
All of a sudden, there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> or <unk> or Black Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written that we <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video you come up with a minute, just that only one and unexpected can make it the way that these things have been done.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great clip of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> because of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevents themselves properly by the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> to get five million watching and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> <unk> communities of participation, which is totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- from a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrity in the world, Justin <unk> began on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we are all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features -- it's just the current media, but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
This is a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope and freedom of her country.
<unk> as the <unk> entered <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally on vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, let me know it.
They become the silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I was going to get it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and she was a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined to a <unk> task, the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a four years that challenges the fiction, a boat would fit into the warm sea of <unk> ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the pirate rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
So if we first came out, we would first take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast and empty horizon,
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were fooled by the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to take for six hours.
But I remember the lights on the oil platform, front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I tried to, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations shaping a new life combined.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> whose population is made of immigrant people.
Unlike the middle suburbia in the middle class whose existence I was in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get an IT title of the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra tutoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was mostly <unk>
Two pairs of <unk> for school, one to hide holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day and put the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until the <unk> they started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and he studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> and children were trapped between two worlds.
They went for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic classic student, relentless <unk> with what I would do with myself.
In the other, I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, abuse and isolation.
But a lot of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of a scientist, I was elected by the Australian daughter.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't happen.
As <unk> anonymously from <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence she'd never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the routines. and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still on the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What are not going to be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were working on on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new ones on the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort place to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not in the way we fear it.
<unk> they weren't <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, a <unk> <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They went to a small group of people who were <unk> "You can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
It was going to be <unk> to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made a decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 she became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, I caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the room in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, Days went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell us stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came up and told us to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why her hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since the people we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have come to us.
The defeat would have <unk> it very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could look at that for you?
But I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
Can I give you a <unk> in their lives, a brave in every wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see a secure one, it would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing changed since the time of the former Indian American <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with an airplane.
At that time when you were to <unk> the great prince of Prince <unk> had <unk> I had a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he can see water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
<unk> my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technological piece was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense that our phones and the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to <unk>
Let's turn our inspiration.
This is why I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
I read books for the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device capable of connecting the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
They put the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does it do?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, "You know, your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several times, I get a <unk> the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic of childhood -- to those ideas that we teach from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar they always turned me back.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In any fantasy book there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they are also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a child history <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out in the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a little girl, I had a lot of <unk> and stones, and <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids are no longer doing it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual we have to go out and in a chapter, and then a picture of a flower -- and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child from London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and video on and through an augmented reality group that appear on the inside of the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves the screen.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are connected with technology and magic and technology come closer to another.
<unk> power of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of the University was <unk> to an listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has an doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to reach 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> sent my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. And he can see what my problem is in weight, not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but he saw him backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 Twitter followers, on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my scale to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can lead to the people of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, I will be available from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are taking away from their houses, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they return to <unk> and to be captains out of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the cost of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have checks at <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
And also, where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find physical food supply.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> please see <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes they open up in a <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your cell phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to focus on the world level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's pictures that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph came to my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
He mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you hit the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
And so I wanted to create something different, a process that would start with the press <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very small road <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful pictures at the time, but with common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can tell you, but I always want it to be captured in a way like photograph.
So let's think that you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look true.
They're the details or the <unk>
Would you understand light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about how to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it was.
But, at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's turn to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those ones that don't even <unk> the things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining photographs it's very important to <unk> because otherwise it looks bad.
So I would like to tell you that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are taken up with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect experience.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal way, I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even did red the house on the top of the island so it looks more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think it takes for planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job by taking the pictures of the outcome, it can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details, but the general picture.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like a lot of other things we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the yield scale.
Talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
You get more intensity because you write about paper.
Why are we going to <unk> technological curves on <unk>
The answer is that if I draw them in a normal curve that, say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly. We would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it turns out a <unk> change.
If the transportation technology technology -- as fast as we could last <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of the technological development of increasing growth, that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these curves -- we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve -- I know how until it comes to something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe it will happen.
And so we would now be in the midst of a transition.
This line is in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, do is, what is that new way that <unk>
So what new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
That happens to be a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different to extrapolate from what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that you could be <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at it every billion years.
So we go back a few two billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that would spread around it.
If you look at the way that those chemicals were organized to give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there was floating about oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those droplets of oil droplets had held a particular combination of chemicals that they made them incorporate materials from the outside and that drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them had a selection of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> it will be a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better than the time to incorporate chemical chemicals -- they will make more chemicals and more <unk> and more <unk>
Most of them lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemistry, very simple, but things are interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, it will be <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to get it.
The amazing thing is that this system of writing seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide at the airport security.
But <unk> Tom <unk> -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to want 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If you were a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things were going to be very different -- and that was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information together forming the cells that cells.
I don't know if you know it, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin to create their small DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that were in a certain way, and they were together -- and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community to become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were approached so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a DNA chain.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't work alone.
The skin cell is not by the heart, or the muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not doing more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
<unk> are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures that are responsible for <unk> to understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because I knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that we have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures that are really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea of <unk>
I'm sitting here at granted casting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads who have some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now move through periods of similar periods of organisms -- our <unk> methods -- and our data processing <unk> and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> computer <unk> the video tape, <unk> and so on, these specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we've accelerated the time scales.
The first stages of the story that I had told you about a billion years old.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next few years and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the next few years, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without recent IT advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to fit in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and the machine with that does something that you can't do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes there's methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method, I've been using lately, is the evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer take a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these instructions at random, running all those kinds of programs, and you can take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But once again, he could find two numbers in the right order to do.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
And we put those up and <unk> the rest.
And now we have the best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the analog <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will put the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
It was a few mutations in it.
And he tries to try and try and try to another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent to millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in a few minutes or in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that we are hearing perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to test them to see how they work.
These are brown dark programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I was once in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make new design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choices there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so able to run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog time to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part of thinking that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to allow me to give up a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I deal with my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide World
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that I heard of.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who tries to <unk> the first base base of it, don't get time and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone from 10 <unk> to hit four.
<unk> like the world's legendary Williams, the last player of the League <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I would take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has also an record from <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place and a dear self has two arteries and <unk> and your family doctor will move to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know something?
She's getting a lot of getting this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'm going to ask you.
What do you think should be the average of hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is to send them to the world, and I included with the mandate <unk>
I never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message I was in medical school when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> home at the General of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> human diagnosis and <unk>
And they even knew the political diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very proud, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of the medicine school with the impression that if you were playing, then you would know everything, or as possible, as close to everything, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here in Toronto, when they brought to the lady in the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk>
And when I was going, I was going to go to a cardiologist -- I got to go to that patient.
And reporting to the chief <unk>
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, blood goes to lungs, these are acting on blood, and that's why there is difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was going to do.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him a <unk> water pills that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief <unk>
I didn't wake up the phone and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to pay attention to me.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
He was sent to his house, he didn't take attention to a voice in my inside that he said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't you <unk>
In fact, I was so unsure that I asked the nurse that he would love Mrs. <unk> "Do you think he's okay if she goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and the ambulance with the ambulance on her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal in your stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that point, I did something that I don't do normally do.
I went through the emergency emergency room.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another, he said three words, those three words that most doctors from emergency emergency.
Other specialists who fear the fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the <unk> patients.
The three words are: you remember you?
He remembers the patient that sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and the edge of death.
After an hour of having come to her home, after I gave him the high school he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought it into the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe <unk>
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They had medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected to be used against every hope that they would be.
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never <unk>
He had a technical brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was happening.
And to the ninth day, she left her to go. Mrs. <unk> mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few weeks, I was excited about it, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt just, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make the peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The embarrassment of which I'm talking about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt like that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I had the things and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
<unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, <unk> opened the sky, and finally the sun came out, and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if we were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would follow those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, I was an art department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He gave him penicillin and he sent him up to his house.
But as he ran to the door he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made three words, he remembers you?
Remember the patient he saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can look at Google -- it's an infection, but it's an infection, and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, she didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and recovered in a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
It was an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, and I called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
And I looked at it and when some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, I called a surgeon.
They were both operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I get older, I was hooked.
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most significant people have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and no support.
And here's the problem: If I can't afford to talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I think I would have a hard time in looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones I know; they don't sleep and the ones I know; they have <unk> results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you care about medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a poor medical study and medical errors in order to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote to the Toronto, <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs is going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where ecological infections are more and more, causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 <unk> by errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we are not <unk>
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story came out of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars -- they don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- you know, not no one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, white, art is already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgical surgery, "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
And their students <unk> down to go down the head and put it up and start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The redefined doctor is human, you know, human, and it's not proud of your mistakes, but it will try to learn what's happened to teach others.
They make their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They had the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving loving and support and support so that they all fall apart.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they become errors in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, we would make mistakes.
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of election that says to pick an average American are about 70 per day.
Not a long time ago, in one research followed by a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks of these executives and the time that they were trying to make decisions about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> works a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many people in the middle of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How are the way to grade the way that deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to pick up the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In the other way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for please <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, the Stanford supermarket, this was very, very <unk> at least at the time it was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park of <unk>
There was 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I asked one occasion, why I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf of the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes -- including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
I put a post to <unk> right at the entrance to the store.
We put out there in six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a month ago, which when there was only six six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were only three percent of us got to buy <unk>
If there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six that if they were in 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably need to get less -- <unk> less is good to conserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices are affecting us very <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the kinds of savings decisions about the retirement of about a million Americans, from about 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available to savings plans to retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had plans that ranged from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there was less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that provide <unk> the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about <unk> the rate of participation went down to the 1960s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, more people are being eaten by avoiding stocks or investment.
In terms of the more options, they were more willing to invest in financial safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety safety
But none of these very extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the human financial well-being.
In the previous decade we have seen three major negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they make the decision, the <unk> even when this is in against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and in health.
Are they more likely to pick things less <unk> although objectively they go better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to contrast it, and to choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've made in one way or another, in different research, so you can test it in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today, which is more.
People always get upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is that if you choose to cut, get rid of it, get rid of strange choices, there will be an increase in sales, the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> were increased by <unk> by two major sales and lower costs.
You know that retail retail is now offered 45,000 products.
In a store Wal-Mart is offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world today is <unk> and it gives only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to manage the choices is the Moore of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a insurance fund.
Those who really want to choose, are they offered to be 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people often say, "I don't know how they <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't make their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a few vacation with every paid for the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take a hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Good. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first trial, which in the second way, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> of <unk> which is <unk>
For people that people understand differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very carefully very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit or debit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were invited to a <unk> plan.
And at that meeting, we found out exactly as a <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we add was that we would give them the staff that you would think of the positive things that they would have in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can manage more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway for example.
We saw that in retail <unk> throughout the corridor of the <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different guys to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Well, there are some of you.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This framework framework is totally useless.
<unk> should tell you something to <unk> not when the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those big <unk>
I suppose who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if we just do it a little bit.
We need to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision for a car.
This is a German German manufacturer of cars that allows <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each other.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go in a lot of options, 56 colors, just like four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> always the default button on every decision, this indicates you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to a few ways, the default button just over and over again, and another time.
The <unk>
If you go from few options to many, they keep there.
Same information, the same number of options.
All I did was disrupt the order in which the information is presented with.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of changes does not say about the preferences of inner decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now we have more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can do this <unk> we can manage more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are working on.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter had to write to the government.
I had to record a piece of text from the machine written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written message on the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of that someone could do this, how much of this will solve the freedom of expression.
We will never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having some yellow dots printed on every page that you have a pattern that makes them and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, they use a lot of money.
There are actually a lot of the <unk> online, <unk> which would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online but they do it by illegal media by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy the <unk> computer.
The U.S. secret service -- two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this is <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> don't know her <unk>
And I say today it's more likely than any of us will be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> which we see today is not driven by the money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate you for opinions, they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying an enormous role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States of the United States that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall of the last fall because of a <unk>
They got the safety of the site and carried out a <unk>
Last week, I asked one of the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack of <unk>
And the response of him was yes.
So, how do people die from a cancer attack.
<unk> is an absolute authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they would have a foreign foreign authority.
And they were going to make it <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters were the headquarters for the Indian secret police police in April 2011 and during the <unk> building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those roles was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a big scale of the U.S. citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
That means Western governments give them tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago was found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going further.
It will support the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be confident we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the South African National Park.
These are the cows of my father at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk>
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead and I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and why we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying that they protect our community and livestock -- and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions they killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at age <unk> is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually, this was not <unk> because it was even helping the lions to see the pen back away.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But the lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, but the second day, and they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't die.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the switch and turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the little box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and they would get the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see them. You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used by a whole Kenya, to scare other predators as depressing.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
And I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in meadows in the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes and to tell me that someday I would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when they grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on another electric <unk>
What's the next part of your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric power.
<unk> I know that the electric fences are already invented -- but I want to make mine.
CA: You know, I'm going to take it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot, Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it on every step that <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small age, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until all changed from a sudden changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from the colleague of my sister.
That said, "When you get to -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in two weeks before.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we are prepared to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking on the front station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in her arms looking at her mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine beat North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few they survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> all my around it was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, just across the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be as the refugee refugee would be.
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but they're also dangerous, because North North refugees were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible <unk> back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested for the Chinese police, and I was being arrested at the police station.
Somebody had been accused me for being <unk> then I had my skills my skills in the Chinese language and made me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at <unk> <unk>
But many people can be arrested for Chinese police, and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and sentenced to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
But I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans not had so much luck.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all of their world can be tested in a instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be a risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even I went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or a <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call a pride of mine.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the market exam to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent to my family, and as blame, my family was going to be displaced by force to a location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to get them in a way, for more than 3,000 kilometers across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese Police officer.
He asked you all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> <unk> who was <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money in order to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the <unk> border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance of the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
And at that time, or the voice of a man ask me, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to take them from prison.
I read him with all my heart, and I said, "Why am I going to <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I told you.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown unknown is a new hope for me and for the people who are <unk> when you were <unk>
And it showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
And over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, we met South Korea, and I met South Korea.
But to achieve its freedom is just half of the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language, practice.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us still keep in touch with family relatives, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I have received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure they're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, fast terrain.
So the planners of the city came together, and we thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles as if this is <unk> what's really wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk> land.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to carry kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases, in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I would just stop seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they go from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see wheelchair wheelchair and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving a few minutes back to go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet to me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, the Green Green <unk> we got together and we started planting our food <unk> trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do is, we are a kind of a paid group ahead and made it ahead of comprised of gardeners of all the city <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came to me, and at <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, <unk> <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court criminal for plant food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It's 68 kilometers of <unk> land.
That comes to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for plant <unk> million plant plants.
Why the hell don't look good at this?
You put a plant to a thousand, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
Turn your own food is how you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up there. Tell my kids there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It will be taken away from seeing what the earth can be done, if they let them leave your canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became an education tool, from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We're the land.
It will be taken away from looking at the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one time, who came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces the why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't realize that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at your time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared his stories about how it had affected them and how they used to plant her mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people coming from, and they work and <unk> all of a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be taught if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind people who put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're caught. I see color that are on this road designed for them, which doesn't take it nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you get the next George Washington Post.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block block -- where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into coffee <unk>
I don't know.
I'm not talking about free things, because it's free, it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try and work to people, take the kids on the street, who know the joy, and the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets for farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
The <unk> take their <unk> right?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very beautiful road here.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, that it rains very much.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that you know.
And especially if you're going on the <unk> and these cars are going to go very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road to be in the world.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so all of the rain water flow around and will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and they will have a road ever anymore.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, the whole noise of it, so it's a very quiet road here.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface <unk>
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can touch your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the harm in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> as I said, so only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if they <unk> they will be thrown out of the <unk>
So, if you drive down the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt little bits of steel steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can be especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is you heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are getting down to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven. is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, you actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a <unk> trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were making the test on road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, we were able to pull them back into our <unk> machine, and we took them back and we put them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we have made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the surface of the road, you can even save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about it as well.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before you can show them how the repairability works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC who was News in his little gray.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban was <unk> screamed for my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came out of Afghanistan and made that the girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was shocked, as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be out there, to go to a secret school to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we made a different route so that no one could be suspicious of where they were going.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it seems to be shopping.
The school was at a home, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew we knew our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where they <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> from a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and therefore his father did it.
But my mom became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home to school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risk.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. Can you stop to leave your house during a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So, you still want not to be <unk>
Today, I'm 22 today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the time, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate at <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just fall out of my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I took it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in a big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, to <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who like the friends, <unk> for them, despite even in front of a opposition opposition to me.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to his house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> him that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school is told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
It turns out that these changes wouldn't last long after the retirement troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who are <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see the future <unk> and effective change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I read it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I'd never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you will never have a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
It's almost two years since the revolution broke the Tunisian revolution inspired by the streams of <unk> mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> in and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men were in the stage, they were in the middle of the regime, the <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a copy of <unk> by dealing with the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the East <unk> to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a few losses for about 50,000 people were releasing our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have wanted to do a lot of other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a <unk> and fair transition to democracy and national evolution.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we started the Women's Women of Women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, of orientation very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and the peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, <unk> the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the murder of the killing of the American Ambassador and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of official officials from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their acute <unk> of human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect to the law.
Our society, made up of a revolutionary mindset, it becomes more than the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
The <unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us to talk about our success story from the success of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I am here today to argue that we, as a nation, we chose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections were not brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both by men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election that the election needed -- that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the immune representation of the female more than the more we need <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as an outrage of outrage that we have a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not just <unk> but also put in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> is desperately desperately in order to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives, and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans the entire humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and women have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is all of the existence.
So you can tell us, "My mercy goes on all the things."
So you can tell us, "My mercy is <unk> on my <unk>
They all tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a biased question that has an answer equally because of it.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one they all do. Why is she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had just been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my soul -- I would send myself to the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, he loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> rather than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where fall every year, millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of the <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the bulk of my career working for companies on the <unk> list between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been married almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all religions, all of all religions, all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> or said otherwise in families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be with a man that sticks, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls are killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City, and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also had a <unk> university at <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had a few big <unk> like blocks, and a <unk> <unk> and he seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did since the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from me: which had gone to Harvard, that I would put a passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going to go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I left my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head of a physical and financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
So as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns because of the trauma that lived smaller.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious to danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that they were happy for always, because I loved her and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was simply a sense of <unk> for the wedding and actually form a family with me.
It was a single accident, and I would never make it damage.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that we would have a few times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon.
<unk> continued to take one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was thinking, when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in his life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had really good company.
So back to my question: Why am I going to be <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to cope with their <unk>
The other question all the world does is: Why don't you just be <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that makes people, because we have the victims, we know something that you normally believe -- it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has reached the end of the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to protect the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> her mother.
And yet we continue to ask why it's just not <unk>
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> beat up that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved that would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family and family strangers, and I'm here today because I am here today because all of you would get me.
We have the tendency to advocate for victims like headlines, <unk> women, women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people it's a way to say <unk> as if the <unk> victims are <unk> <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a predictive lesson of what happened to me and that they would undermine their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a cute little guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is ever come back to yourself, is a gun that is charged with my head in the hands of someone who says it will.
At this moment, the same time are thinking, "Wow, that's <unk> or <unk> which was <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, to her sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love -- it's being the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need the whole world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the abuse to the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family friends.
They <unk> their view of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
We prescribe the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe way.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress myself like that.  Luckily, I've brought you clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women were getting <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go back now, but you find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These days are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to get this sweater over the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while you cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
It was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me to take my back to the back and you get the baby hair.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I made two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, while shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, will be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape, to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to take to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing up, and maybe there are some people from the fashion that they would say, "These are <unk> Joan <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, you know, for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is less than four percent, not white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: "Can it be model when you think <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't know about that.
But then what I would tell you about every one of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of writing from American <unk> or the executive director of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have a little bit of your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you want, is to say, if you want to be president of the United States, but your car adds up to get away from underwear for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos were <unk>
And yes, they pretty much spread all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I looked at, and the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: "Is it for free?
I have too many of them in the <unk> of 20 inches and never use, except the few previous ones, but the privileges I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop, and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges because I look like what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their appearance, no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there's only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so they are not a matter of <unk>
How many times are I <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that to 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people do is: How is life in a model? model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you are a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you feel very happy and I'll be very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative and creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my life every day.
And if you're ever asked, you know, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most unequal legs -- the brightest hair and the back of the fashion is probably the women physically insecure the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception of the success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was much greater enough to attach a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't have the <unk>
There were no directors of <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even even a very bad care in light.
In fact, most were taken by random tourists at random.
My story begins when <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
It happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you have a <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey.
This is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to take us out of it.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
Never no one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever dealt with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is from a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a matter of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in a week in October and thinking about our time and our evolution over the years, not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope for illusion the year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking around, when they suddenly stopped in the dry and a red <unk> of the tent of dolls that came up with small views of previous weeks.
And he described to me what had felt about five years of foot in that same place.
He remembered that remembered his heart <unk> with strength by the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are memories of memories.
So, I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes a picture.
Today I want to encourage everybody to appear in the picture, and I don't want to encourage you to get up to someone and asked him, take a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, like a stupid <unk> <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press on <unk> laughter, laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World in the New World that are mainly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the Old World Cup where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face high risk of extinction.
So, why are the <unk> <unk> First of all, they provide life ecological services.
They're our <unk> our natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers up to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria are helping to absorb the anthrax that they will not stretch and cause huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Now studies recent have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the old culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of protective and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and under Egypt.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are a few very important <unk> to open heaven -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which is the <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are the victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical <unk> of <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall off of the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned by veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs you have a huge amount of time to <unk> the number of cases of anger has risen enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in "Africa: <unk> <unk> they're going to be up the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible <unk> trade to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a locally locally it's not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell them to tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you tell them about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be far poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
So from <unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I don't.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa Rica from <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, which Italians were good at, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where we did so we decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local tomatoes Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would give them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were amazed that the local ones in so fertile -- in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking them how it was possible that I didn't know anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> in time to save the people from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought we only did a lot of Italians -- errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, were doing what they were doing -- what they were doing -- and then to see what they were doing, and then I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has been <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if you were my kids, you want to much."
I try to deal with all of the different culture as if you were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first of the help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman opened this conference put a stick on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can imagine you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to get 27 years to just answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never give anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have a dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You can never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We get together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give one idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, we were going to ask them, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with our <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know the known, because they don't touch their public meetings.
What do we do? We work for one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician for the company, the family doctor of the business, which has come to you in your house, at the table of their kitchen table -- in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia, and I started this as a test.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
And so I was <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, the '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the business of the business spirit.
So now we would have <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to give it a <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and <unk>
What are you going to show you more this morning.
People local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils not renewable renewable <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> we met this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be in 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve, and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> they were <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would put in New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States were <unk> <unk> generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you."
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And I later will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to count with a terrific financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not yet born.
We've looked and looked at the 100 companies icons in the workforce, <unk> <unk> and all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, just one: No one was started by one person.
Not the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment -- in coffee bars next to their kinds of comrades who will do for you, what somebody did in this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who speaks to you, what would you need?
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't go through a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public space.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for cows stores for our communities to reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with giant <unk> which give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city in a city.
I always support music --  -- there's a <unk> in New York City <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful programs in the world, but also one with the highest amount of U.S. <unk>
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a rather pleasant space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Their death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death ...
And this led me deep gratitude for the time I lived and have been alive.
It led to the significant things about my life today.
But let's just take it for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to grow up on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted about her sentences to <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be tested for <unk>  Before I died, I want to sit on the line of change in <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to take you once again."
Before I died, I want to go to the <unk>
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort and comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to conserve perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will be more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than we care about individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us, not only can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very hot.
No speech, but it comes glad that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
They share it -- what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the skin color.
I don't care about religious differences and notice about this: it's never <unk>
When singing our childhood, trying to honor words that I can't even believe -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel <unk> 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the ultimate memory <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it remembers the year that I came out every songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, and I get in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and <unk> birthday.
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although I didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were autistic and autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication and learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every single individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that will be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that faster increase in the world, there is no cause to <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room, looking around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything there was <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were getting more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a <unk> and innocent nature of a child that would see the world without <unk> a human being had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about the <unk> communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change through normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean you're wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Whether autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside of it, and honestly, the search for normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment where we are trying to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced the little thing that must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to give me a communications, which would give me a kind of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> from these students with their great minds, their big books and their big unknown <unk>
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the hole from the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
So I sat down when I had those conversations with the students, I looked at the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We need a lot of communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you just study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the fabric structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that making dumb <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> bullets kill me, and they put their presentation together.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's moving too much in the area of the language of our brain, and we will be <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the single design of the <unk> Tower of <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple line, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that will apply to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it is <unk>
I think these are just some key things that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford words of English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one looking for a public charge of no matter <unk> and platform or start, and when wins, got it over the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament, allowed newspapers to quote the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
She was put in the London Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's a literal thing.
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of freedom.
But to show you really how words and politics are interacting with -- I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
Didn't you know that.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
We had all sorts of suggestions you could have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the American People from the U.S. People <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of you just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about a quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was going to be used for three weeks.
I read a day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want me to have Washington <unk>
They didn't want to call him the King of what he was going to give him or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give the more <unk> and more unfortunate title of the longer you have happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. already existed before, but it just meant <unk> <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> was really a insignificant.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who's going to take a serious <unk> <unk> title as a <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> by the title.
President Barack Barack is lucky to keep there, waiting the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we will keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to do with you, is that the title of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles not and so on.
Reality and history have endowed in the title of <unk>
So in the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk> at the time.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really change the words much more the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 foot under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
And I hear voices that talk about but, especially that cacophony of male <unk> and stones and <unk> with primitive.
Like others, I take a cheap firefly <unk> attached to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter which drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
And my hand was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who lost the control and dropped countless meters on that hole.
As I talk to you today, these guys are at deep in that hole at the time your life without pay, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they might never will, because they're slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Mexican Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been engaged in modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not just like the grade.
When we ended up talking about speaking to me, I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It made me <unk> and the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
For some, even when you thought about my second home.
But this time, we will take the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of it about slave <unk>
150 years ago the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
That's the equivalent of <unk>
However, today, you can inspire entire families for generations for <unk> dollars 18.
<unk> slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by <unk> and <unk> promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods that are produced by slaves have value, but those of them produce are disposable people.
<unk> exists in almost everybody else, and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> on <unk> temperature, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brick in their heads to 18 at 18 at the time and these are the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> not to drink, and the severe <unk> would make it pee very <unk>
And so they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and just let it work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment that these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I could not offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already there.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for their liberation and he trusted that he was going to go.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children than the load and the kids put them to their heads with straps <unk> made of sticks, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something that <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the entire life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk> their homes.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness told me that it would be hard for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I got women who had been <unk> <unk>
It led me to a couple of stairs <unk> that gave this dirty <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms and private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of so seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every year is dark and <unk> identified by a number <unk> on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> fear -- and at that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where they were going.
There was no <unk>
There was no big enough windows for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, you touch a topic that is so hard, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the workforce in <unk>
I visited Indian villages in which there were entire families in the trade of the silk trade.
This is a family portrait of it.
The black hands of black people are the father, the blue <unk> and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me about their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, be able to get out of this house one day and go to another place where we pay ourselves our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake -- <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to look at a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, a sense of it, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work on their <unk> in these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was <unk> which was a little bit <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear is thrown into water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of their love, he's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when we were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they are filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the World," the <unk> <unk>
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to take it on a path of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go back fast.
Then he pointed out this path as just visible and said, "This is the way -- this is the road.
As we start down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photographs of photos on my head as I put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that I could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their backs and, as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a very well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 feet and these people have carry these guys carrying them together heavy stone bags that then will be shipped to another area where they <unk> the stone to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the side of it, we see to other fewer fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When they die their uncle, <unk> he did inherit the debt of uncle who force him to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, I had been working in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors were saying that the doctors were saying it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has to be liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of face to a remote instrument, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted to know that we will give witness to them and we're going to do anything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to <unk> atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights and dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think of in these many beautiful people, I would argue that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images take a force in the people who see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns to a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do a math math and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like management management,
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
So dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary education, a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's <unk> destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a dance <unk>
Over the last few years has been made progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we're going to know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and an objective and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological test test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could get <unk> ourselves?
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, what I want to do, as a conventional way to a try, you see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds to speak, and we can imagine as a dance dancers because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that are needed -- for example.
And as the ballet did it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of the vocal cords as <unk> and like Parkinson's affects <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> from string ropes.
We see the same <unk>
shake the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, both are not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole range of hospitals to do it.
These are both <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> <unk> they're not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a cost that's so <unk> it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> of patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could do this massive <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative,
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these targets.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call <unk> and to take recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people might say, who's healthy and who not?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the disease of TR: Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not hear it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances it's important because we're looking for the <unk> the confusion for the disease of the disease of the disease.
TR: They have a accuracy of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic work and now has been shown that it works on mobile phone phone too, and what we <unk> the project. We have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was running <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We would focus on the dark, in no windows and then we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin we do is we make the impossible, and we would have done it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, <unk> events that were going to happen.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> There was a <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May <unk> I traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first towns affected by the wave.
<unk> water reached over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
And you know, rubble from canals and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we took the laundry to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We would get rid of it, and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers and neighbors found the similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places from around the villages around <unk>
It wasn't until then that I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a middle of the village <unk>
It helped clean the toilets, the huge, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of that day, I was honored by that day to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that were more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to take a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be as tragic as he had a photo <unk>
With the step of the time, they got a little bit more photos and it took more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were invited to <unk> a town in the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of the <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be done an hour. I could do a couple of weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw a lot of hand using how to guide the areas whose color and detail the water had no destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures <unk> in the saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae and even oil -- all of it together with the step of the time -- I continue to <unk> that was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless I was clean -- dry and <unk> and <unk> for his <unk>
We were lucky with your hand.
We have a remarkable <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As a <unk> once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her, she stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to give them the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures he shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures on a fire station in the rubble station pretty far from where his house used to be home, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your little kids, not so small now, but their two kids were in school in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his son his younger son took her 14 years to him.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past that he was not marked by that March day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had come up with hundreds of them -- hundreds of them helped us to clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority -- -- most of them became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 hundred and hundreds of pictures totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one thing, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would have but the first thing that we would have to look for.
This is about the project, about to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger, give it something, using their talent to something that are not thin thin skin.
To finish my email I would like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, and he was struck by me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my newborn daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our very few basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk>
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create videos in motion camera in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they really challenge the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and you go on and go on and go back in a <unk> <unk> and you can create a <unk> package -- just a millimeter in size.
And that packet of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet a half.
If we take that bullet and this set of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how are those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
So the pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a set of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Some of the light is <unk> it goes on the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights to <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and the current and we make it run the same distance and we see it in a slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much they think would take us to see that film?
One day? It's a week?
It would be a very boring film to a little bullet in motion.
And what about proving nature to <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> out of the table, the tomato wall and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, he thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition full.
But if you look at it once you look at this tomato sauce, you realize that, as the light is <unk> from tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces into its interior and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera on MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture at the low exposure, it comes into very little exposure, light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest one, so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package billion times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in a crude way, in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> I would allow you to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could just throw some light out of light on the door. You get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects but we don't know what extent to the distance.
So by projecting a laser you can record a <unk> picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the object.
Can we see that in <unk>
This is our reconstruction for.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going on the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> you could actually see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a asked for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization modality to solve the problems of mammography mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, turned science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time are not just for scientific <unk> but we can be able to be able to do it.
So creating a new form of computer photograph with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those ripples -- remember, the time between each of those waves is only about <unk> of a second.
But this is also something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you go away from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. And Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes have been invested in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can make your life, and it gives you an individual freedom.
With a cell phone it can <unk> a crime in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, it gets to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who from the other?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phone.
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. You all have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my phone, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission in the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet vendor in Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in his phone company or his Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who was then was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for please all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to her, and I didn't get a concrete answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to take a lawsuit that I wanted to have a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it, a deal.
They took the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown on a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and 5,000 miles of information.
I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to be <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and stop, go back and forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I'm going on a train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they're called each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what time they go to sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who's talking to whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today state agencies and business agencies want to store as much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to use it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, which is not <unk>
When you go home, you send them to your representative to your representative that only because business agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that show you to remember they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
My mom six times in six different directions in six different directions -- <unk> at the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain cerebral and so <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. Isn't that genetics.
It's not <unk> and it can be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It just happens by accidents, as I came up with birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want you any one in the room.
It feels wrong for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be a disabled moment.
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> from Christmas, are at the commercial mall, drive in a bunch of parking circles, and what do you see?
16 places in the disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same first beginning.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters older people went to public school, my parents tied to the school system, and they were glad that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the weather note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactical thing that I used was just just a dollar to be in front of me so that I would have it.
The <unk> I'm wearing was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a boxer who has received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabic in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all of the family --  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians thought appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as it <unk>
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to seem to be a lot like dying of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating it, so <unk> of the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I learned to walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and I want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we won't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
On summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and he wore hot cups on the back, <unk> me on the back, and I remember the water would give me the eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand on <unk> <unk>
And now I can stand up in the head.
My parents would come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital in <unk>
I went to college through positive <unk> and I got a fellowship for the University of the state of Arizona, because I walked in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet of the theater department.
All of me.
I did all the least smart, but I took the highest note on my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow to Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk> "When I have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
By the end of the end of the end, I was able to <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end of this <unk>
I didn't get the role.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater, and crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me because they believed that they could not make the stunts of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts I can't do the <unk> either.
It was a paper that was literally born and was given to an actor.
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with no disability papers for disabled papers.
I came back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was as extra as a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the road directors are not <unk> actors -- <unk> <unk> <unk> with disability.
Just give them a perfect person.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour of my first tour, I led to famous lectures. from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led to the <unk> of the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs around the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, not censorship and <unk>
Some people say that I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant <unk> that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother with another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media, at the time to remind the bus directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the stigma challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was a time when I was invited to the news program on the wire show back with Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I were at a school dance, and I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the desk desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, I was <unk>
In order I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew I wouldn't have been <unk>
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but she was just like I was able to <unk> and hit my chair.
Something really fun that I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but they never get me out of me or a little girl and even higher.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
You put online clips to comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite example: <unk> terrorist <unk>
What is it?
We really should be praying for it.
One reviewer suggested that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors were saying not to me, but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in New Jersey performance, in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity organization to give Syrian refugee kids, a tiniest fraction of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father watched me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call my <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young boy of a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything to him, it goes to the big city, in this case, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, no perspectives of future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you get a man who gives you to take it to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He meets a <unk> group of people, who gives it a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, your family.
They present to a young guy.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy in that little boy with the dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small child in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him.
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that got him out of what we call <unk> period of <unk>
And your story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, to well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunity, you have the history of <unk> the door of access to violence, to violence -- will be the history of 2.0.
And in my hometown of born, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 isn't working, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few youth leaders at a business level.
I took up to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had an rainwater on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he was a graduate college college student, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other medical organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest obstacle to the point B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> he saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It began to recruit together to local residents who normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story about?
What does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
Tell young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business skills.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until recently, until recently, until it wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
He created a farm outside of <unk> and he began to grow <unk> and <unk> that he could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
No public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink roses <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGOs, working for government, but their story, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> from change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and creating a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and set up their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, they prescribe the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Peace Park that's how it calls it, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks Parks that <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> in the New York City <unk>
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not the way that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings on step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts and <unk> balls of aluminum <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
It doesn't matter how they <unk> or where they do the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and it's about 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and I walked down the pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need more to go into more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I'm not just going to just travel in the trucks.
And the <unk> and the <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
You all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as mainstream as they believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you get very quickly.
It takes a lot of used to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of taking over their body of garbage and all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of Alan <unk> the collection of waste is one of the <unk> most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and go into the traffic and all the day and they pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
They never stop coming.
It's also like a breathing form or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And the stigma.
I think stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to get rid of its <unk> and its dangers inherent are threaten us in very real ways.
So we had controlled for decades and centuries they come back to <unk> and they start to <unk>
The economics needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of economics start to fail when it's endangered the consumption.
I'm not advocating that capitalism, just to point out the relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed we need.
And so I mean just the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't care about it, and we can't clean it up or take us our coffee cup -- our stock market, our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that we would have to commission it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe helps to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that they keep us safely from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> collection in the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and he went down the stairs and there was a man doing his paper ride like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after I began to research the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together so many times, and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have a species -- we have to include all the costs, even the real human cost.
<unk> waste what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought up two recent projects like this.
Both of these projects are located in countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of crystals generates heat in the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And third, it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually enchanted by the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building, by applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to the site of the site, which is located in a very much growth area of the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs in the building.
And this spreads with an <unk> inside, which creates a space in the open air in the building that will be absorbed by its own shape, the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that we would give to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete concrete <unk> to allow the air to air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we get inspiration out of these beautiful buttons of the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me shape the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of little pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what you get.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to account there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was so much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it didn't need to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which collect water for the interior <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen connected access to the straight lines of straight across straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first of design we did was expand the streets existing by creating 12 early early blocks in size, and features to which there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the final operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation, to it.
So let's make a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set a higher density in the upper levels and a lower density of the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like to give up the community that was occupied by building space.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get them up and make such a activities such as a <unk> <unk> for the morning, or to jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had a very bright bunch of hair and a little <unk> of <unk> cute was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> I was a little late and I hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher grades.
And then I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit like this.
All the way --  And I signed up to return the book to the <unk> but some of my other roommates had really good notes as well.
So, in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row out of a row -- just for being there, since I was there.
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was that it was all obvious to it.
I will never be surprised.
But most of all, I would tell you the reason why this little girl was so small, so small to <unk>
It gave me jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
You also smell the <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one percent murder in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
That's why you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab that you study in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was not any jealousy, <unk> there would be not literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk>
No Shakespeare.
<unk> the lists of reading high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would be no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No jealousy, no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, most of them has all of them.
This year is now 100 years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> of the <unk> <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as a cat.
I don't know what a cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as jealousy, which comes to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel accurate, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they are designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being a <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details to <unk> the knife <unk> right?
<unk> do us all <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm he detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of hair, brilliant <unk> and the cute little <unk>
The <unk> ran from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the language by jealousy.
When <unk> is in its headache of jealousy, listening to the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're looking for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful -- in fact, what to <unk> the more agonizing the truth better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to make us suffer, it causes us to make a range of feelings much deeper and vital than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> teaches us to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us, our <unk> our awful ambition and our <unk>
Do you have any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something bizarre in that man, who didn't get away in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing it -- <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity and <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And because of this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of illegal <unk>
The <unk> they drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years, I <unk> I am also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan was captured by having created a fake account of Facebook from which he would send terrible messages to be sent by <unk> for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big, even if you can say, creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character in the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> -- Mr. <unk> books that try to how the beings <unk> our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a instant.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take out of your own self and <unk> from what you're ever <unk> and it's under the ground on your name, it takes your rings, cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I wanted to want.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of the curse <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always said <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it does.
Oh, I sound so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the each one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> in <unk> all with their solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
And the next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate it to it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction fiction. jealousy.
<unk> used to be invited to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and descended on the Sea Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were themselves, but his presence in the gray gray gray, was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo did work for about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 people, and he asked universities and government agencies.
People were killed, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, of which he <unk> after death death, last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do we <unk> The cynical answer is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of <unk> at the University of Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why does John F.
Why turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a western victory on the Cold War.
At the time, the most strong emotion was the <unk> of the <unk> of the powers of technology.
It was because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon came up in a context of a long <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship but in 1969, the Apollo <unk> 10 flew 40,000 miles old / hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful joyful story about the power of technology has been transferred to what problems we imagine that technology would be going to solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seems to have been able to have a result.
I remember watching the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube of the rocket that Saturn <unk>
I knew vague that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I would come to see colonies on Mars.
So that didn't really happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists have found us, and they had enriched us, with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the sale of <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But not <unk> the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that they were <unk> Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically, incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs with entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas to be created by the funding of <unk> problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without caring for the risk, they preferred small investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term. We also haven't invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you go.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties -- the development of an antiangiogenic energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they turn out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure at the fashion hand.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are the political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and fashion making, but there will be famines while there were poor people.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President <unk> read him the war on cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years seem to have been finding effective treatments and viable.
Bad problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can have and <unk> but these four elements have been <unk> political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a problem of <unk> and we should understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it is true with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no science science mythology like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very widespread idea.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to talk about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task -- which I think gives a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have risen in others.
I don't have of course.
But I can take you to survey polls and survey surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no such evidence of it.
I mean, the people who <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago they continue to be pretty <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway along the road.
But it's this evidence for enough?
What public opinion polls are, of course, views.
What else can you <unk>
What you're looking at is the attitudes that people know when you have some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would ask you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in some other not."
What is very rational.
In short, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a kind of a <unk> official or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all the cases.
I might, for example, I said I trust a certain school teacher that I know to give to the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend to hold a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real trust level of real trust, because they try to make the good inherent judgment in fact to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's stupid.
It's not that goal that I was going to do.
I would have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it, you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if it's not responsible for the contrary, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are really sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm very pleased to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for that, but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't met.
But that's what we're going to do is that we are trying to find out before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is it takes more time to do the action <unk> that I will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system that is destined to secure <unk> and <unk> testing is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard work, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
You may all know the similar examples.
So let's get all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should be able to reconstruct the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in fact, is signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough that they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford for all people, all the time.
But you also have to have a set of evidence that you are worthy of confidence.
How do you do that?
That is made every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can <unk> without giving explanations as well.
I take them and give me the money, or you get the money around the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not really hard to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital data, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that gets place in the digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the screen is their physical body to the pixel body.
Designers can reveal their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the entire dexterity of your hands?
In the National Science division of Microsoft, together with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a real work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with chambers cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the keyboard, get into the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines and words with the virtual touch sensor that there is the bottom of each floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we would focus on the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device in your head, or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would you be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> decided to create this only physical pixel that we did.
This imam imam behaving like a pixel in 3D in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And to digitally programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of the time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and <unk> and get to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can be able to show it physically and a distance, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can reproduce it as a physical reality sometimes the times you want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's most fascinating about changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital data is not just showing us something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world around us and we have to get rid of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you hit that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to invite a school for athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After they survive the Cultural Revolution, they believed that there was just a safe way to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether or not.
But my dream was a Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I'm just my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody else wanted to be <unk> OK.
We went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> I arrived in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that he here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> it's about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also gave up to my <unk> <unk>
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map I thought was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research fields like comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, why not do it also in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and political <unk>
By Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of missing in translation, I found that it can be won a lot of it.
For example, it is through the translation that I realized that Chinese <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up to me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I'm not going to feel like I used to feel like or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really not anything compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
So even a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living with purpose and clearly most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you --  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
And Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stood on my office in my office he took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class colleague had a <unk> as a client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could deal with it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy to just move my head while I was doing the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so she was right.
You start working on, home home later, you have children later, until death happens later.
For <unk> as a Alex and I had plenty of time.
But soon after, my <unk> is pushed me to press Alex I'd talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with the guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No no, but maybe he <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this did not cause Alex <unk> to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And then I realized, that this kind of Rosetta benign was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and future <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to age without spending before the <unk>
Put your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're incredible.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream a <unk> you want to see. It's okay. You know, <unk> the <unk> matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and transcendent moments that shape their life will have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People who are 40, I don't panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and they will be transferred to <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility reaches its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has an impact on the person that was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in human development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the timeline.
Researchers call <unk> an extended teenager, an <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> names as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent <unk> like you or your kids and your daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, it will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like play <unk>
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a race, to choose a city, to choose a spouse, and have two or three kids in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there is research that starts to show, which is much more difficult and stressful doing everything from the <unk>
The middle crisis crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that you'd like to work in art or entertainment, but you could still not decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
It was often often in our <unk> but then she got up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cry for almost the hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning I had to go back with his many <unk> but then she was looking at the empty space that follows after the words -- "In case <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if you give me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of hard work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade of Emma passed ahead.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every single man or a woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who will benefit from that identity crisis and identity of identity.
For identity capital I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity is generating capital of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration I shouldn't tell you, which is not exploration, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent to take you at the airport, but the people who come together with friends with similar minds are limited as you who know what you know, how you think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out near comes out of their closest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak ties from their friends.
Yes, half of the people have a bad job, or they don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way we belong to this group.
Half of the jobs that have ever been created -- then meeting the head of your neighbor is a way of getting a job to get a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but do their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when he has a partner and its own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit around 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now, or you will get away now when everybody on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with whoever makes them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she came across to the quarter of a cousin who worked on an art museum in the other state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That piece of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who I alive.
Now, five years later, it's specifically special about events in museums.
This married one man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and I send myself a letter that said, "Now the emergency contacts space are not enough enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles coming somewhere in the west line.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even the next generation.
Here's my idea that was worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling the <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get a capital of identity, using their weak ties.
They won't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them math to seventh <unk> in the public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I took testing tests and tests.
I'll give you assignments.
When I work back, I was grades.
What the attention called me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
And after several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and that easy?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios. And in every study my question was, who are success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what to do to <unk> to military training.
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to <unk> the farther possible in competition.
We studied teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are going to be teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the outcomes of learning from their <unk>
We teamed up with private firms, asking yourself, which of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it came up with a trait as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
Not the good look, physical health, and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination at the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination more likely to be <unk> even when <unk> in every trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little bit that we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you deal with determination in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid work ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest response is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't follow with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, sensory determination is not related or even related to correlated as talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our <unk> intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to try and start to fail, to start all again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whoever is that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature to read enough to read traffic signals, <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how that method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it is possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person with arms on both sides, as if it was shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> of the form of called, but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> this is this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a ship like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a board under the tree, we have the foundations of <unk>
You put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> remember, you remember, because a single speaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two wood together, it becomes very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun goes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, <unk> is <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters would build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk> sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a out.
A mouth that tells them to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film <unk> its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bringing a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex in a kind of industrial <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl wearing the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very little violence on the <unk> magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
Do you find magic shoes to defeat the <unk> of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single one of the magician magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I was watching "Star <unk> a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Only three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  So she was so slid in the room and was impressed like a foot in his foot with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he knew what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be issues of value, resilience and <unk>
I should have the feeling that Luke is one to an army to <unk> the government?
So let's have this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you make Dorothy <unk> your film?
In doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, OK?
Why are there so much force per F, force in the movies for our kids, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read as much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess Princess does not give me the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults which is <unk>  I think at the moment of first kiss. I think, at the moment of first kiss.
My search is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they still there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> focus on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, the boys, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend them from the <unk>
There are no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, as real and charming as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all of the time is still coming up with classic after TED, every one of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the son, or two men who are raising a child.
Until many of you are thinking about this year, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what criticism said when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
Is it very good. Don't let you know that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not its roots and <unk> but maybe we will start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic in the <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that you have to do, in the movie, there is more than a female character that is on line?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something else than the boy that you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I have seen it, and yet I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
<unk> doesn't the test of <unk>
And I don't think I <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis of <unk>
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful and painful and painful conversations on this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's focus on the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 films that how many of them think they have actors -- <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number that this one is going to take you this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it was about.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero, is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man box, is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star character.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell you about my <unk> Go and struggle with just more stories where his job was to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, she lived in Maine and one of the things I liked was looking for the sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
These are covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would invite you to <unk>
I started looking at shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized to see my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 3,000 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see when we can use light <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern hall of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be a brown, but when we use infrared and what we process using <unk> suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemicals of the landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find a <unk> old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this big renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city in which in a <unk> landscape.
And I tried to try to find out at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we used NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly small area that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the science scientists doing <unk> jobs here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of the climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, below a thick thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> that date back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found jobs from <unk> and <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, in the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that dates back in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we're going to focus on a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in using satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote in the Middle Roman <unk> probably was written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So apparently I was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the sense that ideas actually started in 1984 B.C.
It certainly puts <unk> for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to just close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> house.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of obese obese in cars.
They are racing on a <unk> race of bicycles and they go back to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide in front of their house.
There are bikes -- flying around everywhere, and wheels that go back on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the front gate,
The <unk> in the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, and the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse talking to it.
They can feel your blue <unk> tickle in the nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're going to be standing in the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained her living room.
In the room, and making peak of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothing, dancing on his <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> road and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Wizard of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> <unk> of your hands, <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist -- waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
They put up whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk> memories.
I asked him when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All the people who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have been trained to perform these miraculous memory acts using some ancient techniques invented by a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used to <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the <unk> academics were used to memorize books.
And my reaction was: How did I hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the <unk> and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright <unk> but a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of playing cards live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending the bulk of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went on one afternoon in the public library from Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on the magazine written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not a very rare thing as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we've also changed us.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed also any cognitive <unk>
Because we almost don't have any need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined <unk> and <unk> memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College in London invited a Swedish memory group to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that they have brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a battery test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine. Turn off their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow. They found that in the memory champions are breaking up parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> <unk> is managing as an armed race where someone comes up with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who he's about to try to memorize on an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just shook him.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques for the end is cut down to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who told her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity. That's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean nothing for you. It has no relationship.
With all other memories they dance by their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They were good when they come back home to work.
You probably had some <unk>
And when you take that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story goes: there was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired him like entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you don't bring to a <unk> you get to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> her memory poem, and he got off, and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But it wasn't just killed all of us, but it shattered the headless bodies <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so you couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed your eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single time.
I took the <unk> <unk> to where their loved ones were on the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers, or instructions that word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you ask them to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who sitting on the horse on the brown side horse in their lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> be the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, at the first <unk> memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you guys have been invited to the TED stage to give you a talk and want to make it of memory in the same way that I would have done it, if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they fly in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- no word for the word that you're going to confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with it on that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was entertaining.
I would never have waited for it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What is actually about doing is to better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was really very concerned with this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could do it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could make a good deal of <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just as much tricks.
Because they are based on the very basic principles of how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize the <unk> to benefit from a little insight, about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift -- but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
So let's go deep into it.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not hanging out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I was going to leave with you today -- that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, let me me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is going to be so <unk> we are going to be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory skills in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so you know, just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time watching a television television shows, and every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me. And every time I got married, and I would go back and I was wrapped up in a towel -- everybody was seen.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Science is determines in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
And this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it so that it was based on a building built two thousand years ago for the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection. We've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
You see, these stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> has this round thing: columns, red, which are <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the stock values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We would give it off, we gave them so much, that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to connect with those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> And so we start to experiment with <unk> we do swing the way back and over and over and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
One really hard thing.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
It will make the date again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake bake to use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes are <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic experiences.
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we have to do memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and we started to make a swing the way back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- now we have new design techniques now to be a computer, and we find new <unk> a few ways that will be <unk> against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally the beginning of <unk> again in opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of these rare moments when he critical academic and general public and general audience were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a thousand percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> and <unk> how is it possible that they become ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened, because the means of the means around them and quickly learned that those shapes of culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction to these forms.
They did the main mayors of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This is the beginning of the beginning of the new millennium, with other star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architect at the threshold of the new millennium, it actually started to go through the entire architecture.
Think of architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
You don't spend a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before I knew whether which was four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, to get to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it actually becomes the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as drawings looked at exactly the product finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a communication environment, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes us engage with collective memory. And by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of Internet <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no response to what is a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using words and drawings and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum pendulum from one style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with ideas of what has to be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami Beach, can also serve for a sport or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and half a million dollars of the community tied around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make more intelligent buildings smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they give the places to the <unk> the local libraries of the homes where we formed our children, and the step <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that cool way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too quickly for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
They laugh and <unk> and he gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, When did I stop doing this?
How is it that we don't really taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite the time her mom says it all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
The mother tells him and what her friends, or classmates to school, they say, doesn't know who they believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty or I'm a <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that I don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager, which gets these responses to one of the most exciting stages of their life more emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are they going to do this?
Well, teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in your room all <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that are <unk>
This environment is going to be always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the greatest thing about someone in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the <unk> of the girls now.
<unk> size is still <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the hot stars of sport, and the singers who are <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, you probably want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed in the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort to look at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other things start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and as <unk> society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They're going to participate in the classroom in classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical life.
One in five are not attending random classes during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the grocery season, if you don't think you see it enough, you know, specifically if you don't think you're ugly enough, you know, a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it gives it irrespective of what these young people are.
So to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you -- not what you're really like.
The swing on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-worth do do less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy that you can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all over this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like consumption of alcohol and drugs, <unk> <unk> sexual relationships to early ages and no protection and harm and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a work interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that happen?
<unk> this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking for itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first one is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of programs that are available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing that the situation.
So, we need to make sure that the program that our children are going to not only have a positive impact but also an impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
And these six things are starting to start to start to provide a education on your body self-esteem that works.
An education is a fundamental thing, but tackling this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and let's be a better model to keep women and girls in our own lives.
The current status of the way women are seen and I talked about our circles.
It's not good to count with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of its <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not because they see them.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kinds of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can empower people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies to change our culture, so that our children will grow up to grow all their person, valuing their <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are really making a difference in a <unk>
to make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to be the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who have your mind?
Is it <unk>
Is it <unk>
Is it <unk>
He <unk> his <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he would not have a long legs -- <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were to <unk> this and would be able to unlock its potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are being transferred to all.
But let's give our children the truth.
So the way you see that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
They encourage the self-worth in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's switch on each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year old today, becoming insurance agents in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the age of November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially the innocent <unk> but being a prisoner for other young charges in the company, they started planning attacks on about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans will spread by an informant from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't do it.
Later on, it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer named <unk> with a loving American mother, professor at elementary school in the two did all possible to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims are going to meet.
And by experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in every religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> their convictions that they think we have to use all the possible media so that everybody lived like them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last week of week, he and some friends, had been going to study shooting at Long Island <unk>
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shooting <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father my father helped me hold the <unk> on his shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you all of me, especially me, the entire goal in flames.
My uncle turned to the other and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a father, such child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what they thought to them as funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those other people would be crying out to place a <unk> with 700 pounds.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved over 20 times. I was going to go over 20 times. I was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone already to pack and go to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class often was the victim of <unk>
It makes me secret my identity to avoid being the white -- but to be the new of the <unk> silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons we did not developed social skills, to say that <unk> under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I am <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test my thinking was for the election 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I participated in the National Space Convention in Philadelphia.
My group were <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids that we had <unk> friendship, was Jewish.
It took a few days to go out to the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that my entire life had been made to me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job, in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in the development of my character.
All of the life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay gay were bad enough.
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I'd seen in life.
Having been a kid, a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I have wanted to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught myself as a child with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is about being homosexual but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All the nights, Jon Stewart made me <unk> to my <unk> and he helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that will keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone else is going to try to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way. That even though I get myself excited to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to get myself <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the awful pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the terrorism victims I talked to those acts of meaningless acts as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race. That children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film does taste taste and texture.
It feels your body your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that is project to your eyes.
And it has a constantly superimposed voice in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you know, you and you.
There is nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have a sense of your own.
I have no sure that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we are not mindful of us, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is objective objective of it.
<unk> in nature, is <unk>
So there is never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, you know, <unk> that vision.
psychology studied behavioral behavior, neuroscience is to study the brain -- but never ever mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It <unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. And it was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy at the fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience is responding to some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain are doing with what is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problem.
I don't love <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it's not tackles the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they adapt them, how they adapt and <unk> living organisms.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we speak, how we play <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problem.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all of the behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I got to the conclusion that that was not working for reasons.
I think we will stand up at this point.
We have a wonderful wonderful explanation, great. We get used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this schema.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other way, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't yet know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective film includes a sort of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain and the brain behaviors, and they study everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> awareness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me, and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to it.
But I am in a different direction.
In the time you left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
So physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks -- fundamental <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that slingers like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, it's considered principles, and that's what the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts -- time, mass laws. So he applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, mass, <unk> then for a matter of logic, we have to put it back to the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the self as a fundamental reflective brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, <unk> processes.
So physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can get them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, every system is conscious, not only humans -- dogs mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think like, "Oh, you always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling <unk> some different precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy, for you.
How would anyone think that <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's richer, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for different cultures, where the human mind looks more like a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we think about thinking with the physical process, is to give awareness to information.
There is always the information processing -- there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, conscious awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> took this kind of theory, and he developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which is the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I'm supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible level of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, just as much significant, as a lot of consciousness as much important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
And physicists and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a whole bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the bottom.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From vision vision, the equations of physics can be allowed to be they they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's in the center.
This vision, I think, vision vision has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that has consciousness, so I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think that all of this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact that consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system.
It's <unk>
In the vision of information <unk> she has an integrated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right now, you have a pretty serious ethical problems about the development ethic of smart computers and the ethics ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED Talk. At this moment, we have a TED collective consciousness, a internal film for this whole group of TED, different from each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm more sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how are those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it from night to the morning.
But I think we will finally figure it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
It had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I met my friends, my friends, <unk> me with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to give them a community prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice but there's a problem obvious.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in my mother's <unk> and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be as a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of teaching at a high school of <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the lecture 11 of <unk> <unk> a guy up and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you say?
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things in school?"
"For the general room.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability as disabled objects.
And we don't know it, and it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disability people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair and probably you are waiting for you, right?  Yes.  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've been to lie in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> A capital capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and it doesn't make to make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, from the girl without drawing a pen with a pen over the mouth.
You may have seen a little boy running with fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, I would encourage the disabled people to benefit from people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, because of my life, it could be worse.
I could be that else."
But if you're that person?
I have lost the number of times that I have lost strange <unk> to say that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this is happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name --  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will lead to people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so that you can see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really difficult.
So let's get some things.
But the things we have, not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was excited to call it called the social model of disability that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair -- in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by something sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all times.
However, I don't know that I'm brighter than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a little bit of <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery on the battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn about force and resilience from others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've got us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the front of the stairs has never ever become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> at a television screen will not make the <unk> to the <unk> people.
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who are having disability that we will be able to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child from 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think to know about what I know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see virtual reality and professional <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't <unk>
When people think actually <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> their hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happens because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because virtual reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I carry on with the Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
They will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of the game to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that you feel that a man of 110 pounds we were trying to engage with everything else to be.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I had a few videos to show you what to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is emerging is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
Just a moment. Just a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field from <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is about a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We take it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably know most of us.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why with this video.
Man: Oh, great.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a roller roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan here.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball at the fund of the network?
What will your experience when you walk from a mountain to over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they are <unk> adult diapers for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How can we achieve the reality of <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when the coaching <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to his field <unk> so he would play more fast.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, he had radii in the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next big move in front of you, in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
Or for memorize the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing games.
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do this?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every single corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people down the bottom.
You also get information from the sensors, and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sending them to your players.
The good teams will know you <unk>
The bad will have <unk>
This is going to take the good teams of bad people.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and analysis analysis to stop being just in Antarctica.
It's also to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
Let's get the ball and <unk>
<unk> a <unk> Suddenly, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you know, that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
They go to the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor there.
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land. However, the receptor looks at their bombsight -- a grass area that lights up and can modify the race.
It <unk> takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the one from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the party.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the camp.
They want to be their favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it's literally being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how ecologically are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
What's also true for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about the space and science instead of notes and <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is approaching.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, as the usual thing.
Thank you.
And recently, I was struck by after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years I had the country -- the southern tip of the county -- that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, had to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that travel between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so the each one from him will release you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath the <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that no, normally they fall into the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize the death of the death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel steel a bridge.
This is where most people have been to get out of their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the dark time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you about joy that we had success that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
We were going to be able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, Palestinian officials and psychologists trained the new government officials.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 Shakespeare's last year by getting a call from a possible <unk> <unk> sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to Jason speaking of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> he asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came up with <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind and smart guy, smart guy, had just taken your life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the great rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had the <unk>
The death damage of suicide affects a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it were <unk>
What do you do?
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, you don't just want to talk, but you have to hear it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they probably don't have it.
It's just there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask them the question is: "Is it in similar circumstances have thought about the end of life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email only a couple of days, and he is with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> of 49 with his father in the 19th of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and I would call it as the disappeared night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and told me that the car car was down the bottom bridge.
A witness I'd seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied to a radio call by a possible guy on the sidewalk sidewalk near the northern tower.
<unk> my <unk> on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and the next one, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day I'll come back to that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, it was <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that made you <unk> and you gave the hope and then you gave it a little bit of life <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> events from the 11th of the March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been correctly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
In debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> when I went at the General <unk> at San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I know that I did have to do it.
Currently, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspired others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, even though he ended up his own pain, theft the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who considered suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain to be taught.
Typically, this is achieved only three things: <unk> drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I was holding her hand at three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few that have jumped the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one they leave on the fence and they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connects to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge we do is something that everybody and every one of us should be used to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question is: How do you get yourself on that?
I have to be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone, in no way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside I finally hit with my inner truth with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this photo and I think we got this picture, I think, <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs that surround us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom said, "Why do you always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, my <unk> I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to do that?
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, really, is more complex and mystery here.
Because of my success, I never forced myself to share my story, not because I thought that being a bad thing, but because of how the world is to be wrong, but because of the world they want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being female.
I have a mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk>
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these kinds of mysteries.
I was front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when she was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was going, she was responsible for the <unk> and the wardrobe <unk> and that night, I won in bathroom <unk> I won in <unk> and she was a third <unk> between over 40 candidate her.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was <unk> of beauty of women, but I can do that.
I also met the <unk> goddess of everything when I went to <unk> remote <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that I passed my request from the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you hit the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied by me when I was stuck in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the more sophisticated surgery and secure surgery.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who lived in lived his own truth, but he was able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we make a global hub for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood up for injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth living and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day there are no longer more <unk> than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> first, to thank you with all my <unk>
to my parents to support my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been passionate about, and sometimes when they called me and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I would take the phone, and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just identity identity -- that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that <unk> not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to say, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> Thank you.
In many societies.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts were <unk> his efforts in 2011, the <unk> National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when when I was born a girl, their birth will not be <unk>
It's not emotionally not by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes out of his <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when he was born, his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the <unk> but the daughter <unk> the daughter <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school from my siblings.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you get a promise to her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and her family and her family and her family, and if he gave the code of that honor, honor, he could even kill.
And it's interesting that this individual code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and her happiness of his sisters on the name of honor.
And there's a norm more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> and very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and holding the decisions of their father and their mother and the <unk> decision even if he doesn't want it.
If you get a man with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> from <unk>
If you get very young, you have to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more kids and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years ago, I would put it in my school.
So you might be wondering, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I should be <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, but in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where they can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks before, when you put the form of a <unk> Canadian and I was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends would come to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for the <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all political and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper in the blog of the BBC, of the BBC, of the BBC, of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the October nine of the 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would love my ear to my wife and "I've got to know for what happened to my daughter to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please, don't you."
<unk> the fair cause.
You put your life in play by the cause of the truth, because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get paid.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't ask questions again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital and had severe pain and strong headaches from head because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was spreading through the face of my wife.
But my daughter will never be <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when you don't have the task.
They fight his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my mentoring who have made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> by Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you cling to a brain surgery.
You're still just as smart or not?
If you're not like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide on <unk> combinations and mix up chemicals, and try to convince them to keep alive.
I have saved it for me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to be able to try to get the doses of the <unk> because it really doesn't have a map of clear that I'm going to say it in <unk>
I started testing different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the dose of <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking about -- my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I had a dose and chemical <unk> for an <unk> man, and I was surprised to see how my thinking is.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met various types of guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that I had to the front, and it just doesn't happen that.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about the men and about what they have to do, and I have been getting better with men.
What I was trying to do is to pull those hormones and these hormones and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key reference point of reference to the key reference point -- how can I use mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they are <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things differently.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to thinking about, and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring very quickly these mental images from my mind to the screen screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film film was able to use its imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, functional MRI image to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person looking at an image.
The column in the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as you were looking at seeing that same image.
The backbone of the right became <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab from Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's go through this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains were tracking their brains to create a large pool of reactions from the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new new animals, new animals, and while they get a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain data from the scanning of it, to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're well close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you look at an image and when you imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning systems of brain scan available today, and its resolution a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection for images, including me, <unk> with the recent MRI outcome, first we need to ask the next one, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but to this point, magnets more <unk> just with small improvements in the resolution, don't increase by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea, instead of big magnets, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does it matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the FM systems in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field they are looking at <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> to the frequencies of <unk>
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio frequencies -- we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas into direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly by the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be meme. It would be a tool for <unk> our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have few more options than open this door.
But anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just about traditional sense.
I think we all have <unk>
His <unk> may be telling some person for the first time you love her or tell someone you're pregnant, or say to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever spend in life.
This is all going to be a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of this closet to be a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits <unk> of the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be slope that because of my <unk> my pants <unk> and I would give you a head -- I was usually asking a kid -- "Hey, you're usually a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a awkward silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little closer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father said, <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a <unk> look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
An familiar, familiar, but this time was prepared and he was about to get into the <unk> issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
From Gloria <unk>
Even a clip from the "Vagina Monologues," which we <unk>
And then I took a deep deep down, and my back and my backs was a four-year-old girl with a pink dress looking at me who is not a <unk> <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with one question: "Are you <unk>
And so I took a deeper back again, I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, do I know this is confusing it.
I have short hair like a boy, and you saw a boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and you just like to use a broken pajamas.
Because I'm more of the kind of girl from a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me -- paying attention, and he said, "My favorite brother is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all right?
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some blocks in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
This is how my sad self is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why you get out of my closet. It was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared them on bank <unk> is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your five year-old son that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the tough thing.
We need to stop classifying what is hard to do with respect to what is difficult to make us feel better or worse relative to our own lives, and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made up, and it's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, which was a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the <unk> lesbian for fighting any child in four years that would go to the coffee.
I was frozen by fear <unk> in a corner of my dark slate <unk> my gay grenade grenade down, and moving only one muscle is the stupidest thing I've ever done.
My whole family, my whole friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying not to <unk> and now the world was turning back on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> to kill you.
One of my more memorable launches was more memorable was in my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of those guests knew that it was gay, and when I did my <unk> lady in my black dress and my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after I talked a moment, one of the women began, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite favorite TV show.
Our immune program Will and Grace program.
And you know who would be <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of going to show desperately their support, to make me know that he was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts for me.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
What else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you can do.
It's like the hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone who has been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of anything is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  stops the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be bothered by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> by what they have done, but they never talk about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that something in them, not at you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen as a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of it as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the <unk> of computing like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I would have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you know nothing about Earth and Earth or neuroscience of Earth and intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept of the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, which I think -- to a single underlying intelligence mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately <unk> and in particular for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of the future of future future.
Finally, in a robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for several years: There's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future liberty of action, or to keep the open choices with a force force with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like <unk>
The intelligence tries to maximize the future liberty of action and keeping the choices open.
And so having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> investigations in cosmology have suggested that the universes that make more disorder, or <unk> during their lives should have more favorable conditions for the very smart things like us.
But what if that connection, <unk> <unk> between the entropy and intelligence, a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes straight from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find in.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal testing, playing human games, and even making money -- <unk> actions, all of them without having to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This communication skill will have applications for <unk> robotic robotics and human assistance.
This capacity for tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that they can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable into a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections to a social network where your friends are constantly constantly and keeps the net well connected.
This same capacity to network <unk> also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, it's widely applicable into problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> negotiation in a series of <unk> negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under their own exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have vast applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of cognitive cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here is a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you were to put smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, would have a <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's everything else that the urge to take control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that the general intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, rather than the other way around.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Indian Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points around other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the intensity and faint intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that will get us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
Instead, this gives us clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have very quickly <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, I don't know.
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where we find life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites you to a comparison between the planet only discovered and the planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that is shown by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface and search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission are taking samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now provide not just short flights but also the <unk> <unk> to live on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us to deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas <unk> and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most dry places on the Earth, the air is fresh and filled with oxygen filled with our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets going to <unk> with a large and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that we would expect to save this <unk> <unk> the only planet that we know is really livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like the exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to help humanity to humanity is like figuring out that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party actually will have place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, by realizing that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become very advanced enough to consider to be living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are important to protect the origin of planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only is the colonization of <unk> we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put together the hostile environments for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all good down.
I thought to call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it down and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe and the next morning, and I had my passport and my suitcase.
It was expensive, but sure you don't get more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, there was very well.
I'm a neurologist, of profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate -- you get levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which I would think was going to happen.
Or at least, if you're going to be bad things that are going to be the probability that it's a total catastrophe for.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who's the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked to him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing with something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains you -- you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some of the things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so apparent.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, it will make a place for things that are easily <unk>
This sounds common in common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over a thousand years to make track of the location of the important things, where it's good, where the fish are, where the tribes are, where women's trees live, where tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that sits in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets you find the nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys of the car, reading and <unk>
So at home I would take a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport,
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you are <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards, a picture of your credit card license, I passport,
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you are under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful things that when you face to a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved thing, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of our medical decisions, and actually for decision-making and social decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we need to take from that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease attack, the heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you might have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and you are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a fault.
We haven't understood the mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works just from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help an person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to slow down my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But then you have to ask for more statistical statistic and it's <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they are now thinking, "People five is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you can take this over time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take this drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be able to go out of the drug that help you to help you.
I don't say you should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the older men in 50 percent of the prostate men -- the number you need to deal with is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the time the questions that you can pose to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make everything on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have an option a lot of times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain in the end?
These are the things that they speak and think of now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that a bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face Face the face with a predator -- you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could be lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the absolute logical thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be <unk> to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to stop the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of <unk> in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination along with the door, with a key to the gate of the gate of entry into the same way.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: This is my favorite musical symbol of your favorite musical flag.
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree -- there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the sign of the sign of the sign of the sign of the sign of the sign of the sign of my own story.
The French language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time, it mixed with local signs, and the language that we developed today is the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, it's really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound, of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country -- following blindly their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> norms.
So how do I understand the sound of this?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't get the covered in the <unk>
I call all this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the more sound label on what the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about which it's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
Let's go ahead and keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to make it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my own territory of art.
It's going to get me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me as soon as sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be made to me and my artistic work, or my artistic job.
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support equal and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current way.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could go through the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- it will be in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't capture and express up on the paper.
And the same thing can be said for a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sounds of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into lots of different <unk>
If you give a different parameter for every finger as the piano, like the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so while you play the piano, English is a linear language, like it <unk> just a <unk>
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the sign of <unk> on it.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and put it.
This is "All day."
If you get it, and you put the speed, visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same is the same thing can be said to <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic and dramatic idea at the time, we will go again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically on <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it so much in my head like the <unk> like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yeah, so good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please get back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they carry very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving just like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically has no social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people have to understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to hear that to learn music.
The <unk> is a wealthy trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to show you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you get rid of everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom is responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all of these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence, or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because the adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I became older, I found out that the adults also <unk> and that they're not really good to clean other people.
Time country, now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, and collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also so expensive to use these enormous pressures.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream with invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the children that manipulate electrical tools are good and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it the size that we find on the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just information -- information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children would be <unk> a lot with robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned light bulbs and <unk> web cameras and put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this step step up on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm going to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, you see the Internet, <unk> the Internet, and they will come up with this image: here.
A child, maybe smaller than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk> rainforest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where the water is coming in, where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown the mud and the oil is also a brown color, and when everything <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be used by all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help you identify what is in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I'm forced to research a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent.
Over 14,000 people died in a instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant near the water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution for <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look on the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has become secure, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night you go to the center of the <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them, we discussed the data that day and we talk about what we were going to do afterwards, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a map of <unk> <unk> from the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the <unk> dust <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition at the bottom of the nuclear power to the date.
We are approaching a mile of the nuclear power of the nuclear station and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a tracking <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space to dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal metal, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, of fibers, you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with embodied energy.
So for example.
Or, we can help in the mobility of the age transforming their car chairs into new self-driving cars.
The plastic and oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrific truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientific citizens creators, we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that they can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic the one.
One is about the environment, the other I believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the raw, <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information required for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects and trained to think about their objects as opposed to different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores with it.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that involves its functionality through variation by <unk>
Here is a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the <unk> of the <unk> of every designer and architect at work today between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right analysis is shown in both screens after me.
My job at its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving out of the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, Why now?
Why was it not possible this about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they present four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We are designing objects, products, structures and tools through scale, such as this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter that one day not too far to print <unk> buildings, and graphics -- made of genetically altered buildings that shine on the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is otherwise <unk> to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion fashion fashion fashion -- it's going to be <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> on the waist.
Together with 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D skirt on the cells between cells -- I'll show more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> machine.
That designers have access to these high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair to the comforting <unk> and also absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and design this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
You know, this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, is its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously material and <unk>
But it's nature's nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made up trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects did <unk>
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of being produced every year by <unk> crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think if we can tune out your properties, we could generate structures that are <unk>
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on the scale, a system built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these <unk> structures from a single half feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you dry them up, to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> microorganisms, which first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition from no attention to mesh, and if it expanded even more, to window.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first life forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made out of shrimp crystals in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects that are designed to <unk> on the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design design design in the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the lives for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> board, we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals <unk> <unk> new biological pest inside very small channels.
This is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of laundry -- two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans, and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
A converts light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms doesn't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract tract <unk> that will help you <unk> these bacteria and that they would bring their function out.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, we will measure the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted to be more <unk> I would have more transparent.
This digestive system <unk> when you stretch from one end to another 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our intestine very thin.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are the Middle <unk> creatures, just half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints stuff in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
So this cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which it was <unk>
The manufacturing isn't about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts of a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which is those fibers in each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first is turning into the environment, creates a <unk> and then he starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm <unk> to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that <unk> <unk> <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different countries, different <unk> and we've discovered that the way, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing of silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms to the darker <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat -- <unk> the silk worms to the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk <unk> to a online <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to join with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the bottom of the <unk> and as a <unk> <unk> they <unk> and put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> silk silk on <unk> silk -- they give this whole pavilion out of our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> silk worms.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route of the silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional returns in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last line of design is to give life to products and buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, the designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by the design that requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
Can you touch your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and developed websites -- I wrote the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, reaches <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I would tell you about something else, something completely different, and I get myself on it, and I let myself absorb and feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn everything into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me because of nothing.
I was afraid to be afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to give you back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they <unk> they learned from culture.
So we ask first what you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to create nice responses to kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again, as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of being before what your dream.
Why?
If this is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite. Because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though they're good at the same, and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You've got to be <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life focused on our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there's a lot of different issues that look at their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
It could help if you divide into three <unk> and potential and <unk>
You can also use any other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> It's about us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, traveling and design and design by making <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So it comes out of the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we <unk> we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> by having been <unk> in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely started zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a Catholic pianist, an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the finest sales mechanics when they started their practices, and this skill helps to write a compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is a waste of time to go to what you would get to you, even if you finally get it.
You can apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third <unk> is adaptability. So the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, some other web designer -- sometimes <unk> sometimes teacher, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine Company as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that can be able to <unk> to meet the needs of the market that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if they're pushed to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into deep and putting ideas and <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design and careers that we need to figure out how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part they are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you spread out for all the media.
That's where you give the best you do.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep your curiosity out of those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> brought them to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were going to have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he did, he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for the <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's disease is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait for the 85 years or more, the possibility of getting Alzheimer's disease will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the probability of your age of coming out of your age with Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or to be dear Alzheimer's disease.
In the U.S., Alzheimer's health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease today and their costs will increase an increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases that we have invested in less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer research that within Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but all the modern world. Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, scientists, <unk> with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy man compared to a disease patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's came across plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know now that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and identifying what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we put it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, medical biologists, biologists, <unk> and physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. We're now testing a new kind of drugs that will wrap specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened to the test of these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick to each other inside them, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and living a normal life.
This is just an initial result of it, but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, about overcoming Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to have a disease, that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we will, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry on scientists and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not mostly a genetic disease.
Everybody in a brain run the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients that are <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and they will help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times, New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, to do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience in the lab, I myself just last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers were <unk> to get 36 more personal questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions here for example.
Number four: If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you can get it to somebody else.
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number four: <unk> really <unk> to your partner what you like from him or her -- I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you don't know someone you've ever known.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later and invited to everything from the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we had a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent them into the spine a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask them, they go together yet.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because I have done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was published in the article I was so nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had invited myself to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that has been a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I realized it had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and then on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And on Sunday, I had called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing that you have to think about yourself, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search at the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
But even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put a red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experience of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
We got TV interviews, and <unk> the requests for two of us.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether they really wanted to know whether it was able to produce love -- not only an adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and you get <unk>
If the answer was, no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions on this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal outreach, to graduate students in college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt more close to after doing that, several later studies were also used out of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used between members of the police and community, and they have used it among people in the opposite of Afghanistan.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> by it.
And I said, you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom I <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better better after the testing of the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was almost all my adulthood, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or she could live without him.
So I went into science.
And I did what I was able to find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that that could somehow give me the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just did this for the book that I write -- but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I went on.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for love is an icon -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to remain <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media was told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to make some way to mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that you ask, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, we will ask us to ask questions more difficult questions, like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to figure out when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in your <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a very good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still <unk> we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I shudder to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that that choice was.
I didn't think we would have both the ones that make that decision, and how much will you have to keep doing that choice without knowing before, if he was always picking me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and <unk> 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what you want, and what you might spend my life searching for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is a chance to choose someone, and the hope that he also to love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian in full mountain, and in some ways I came up with a forest <unk>
One thing that was a time ago --  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar bill a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it's kind of grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> I like to go on a tour and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, I covered the covered of resin and a bee got <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and he is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, something happened the opposite -- somehow it seemed to grow up size, as if it was that the text with a <unk>
So I did -- I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, and frogs strange bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things my life, trying to go and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw like it is about a dead body in the crime scene.
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from it.
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started to build exhibits and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for example, to go <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I was interested in the human form of the sculptures of these natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on glass layers, similar to a drawing on a window, and then another window and another window, and I had all these windows together to make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked. And so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was going on with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 yards of composition.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed by <unk> ready to commit <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, and there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand is moving clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like being <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn fire to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things -- you know.
Their tail ends up in an eye of <unk> made out of 1986.
Have you <unk> them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very <unk> at your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material or material that are <unk> or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of the archive of being a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They are like cells, they come together, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds of a human <unk> inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> there's the chest, the <unk>
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers your penis or <unk> or whatever it does, a kind of thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game body in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
Can you imagine?
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a musician, a radio <unk> a museum, a school, a school arm, which spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
We put the box and all the people in inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion is that we are different, these concepts of countries, of borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, your <unk> and other organs.
So I'm going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will lead to the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- these are these things to reduce the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the cancer cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects -- in its most negative, because in the time that it takes you to get to your current. Would you get worse and worse by the time that it takes to make your destiny, which is where it's most important, on the <unk> of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the metastatic <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the bloodstream, of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a <unk> treatment for its oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> from the <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery surgery you can use for anything else -- including <unk> transportation of medicines.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small, open holes, and close the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little powerful beam of laser beam over the membrane living membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk>
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> at the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug once releases it directly on the place of infection, whereas the laser is using again to keep open cells again.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if he's successful, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every single researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups -- not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
So what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence campaign and study ways to encourage the transition from violent involvement to nonviolent confrontation, not violent.
I do field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of peace -- between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had been a state between a state and an actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't survive.
The armed struggle and politics are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known by his violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian Palestinian who was known by his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking yourself.
<unk> a complex machinery of communication stations, radio channels TV channels and websites in social networks.
And here have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, run into professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not be and security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan passed through war, or even the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price within the population.
But in general, providing social services it means to fill in a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas can't be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid here.
<unk> because they have gaps gaps by government, and they emerge like armed and political groups, participate in nonviolent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
A part of a territory, running all of their <unk> collect the garbage, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and <unk> nations and the weaker the states are states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap that actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military <unk>
<unk> that government empty has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we do better understand groups better understand what to be able to offer to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors and <unk> the military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace or stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that security gap to fill that security <unk> to fill that government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that they will be able to take the tag tag on the <unk> it would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I would tell myself as a bad feminist thing.
Or, at least, I wrote an article -- and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and the anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> which could be feminist.
It's going to be a feminist -- it was a <unk> a word and nasty.
I was shocked, as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much to high self-worth and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and it can't imagine being another person.
As I was growing up, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and moreover, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
Would you have the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social, social skills, and so much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism isn't nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music <unk> <unk>
Although the letter degrades the women and a offends me, the classic <unk> the classic <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is incredible.
"I actually actually got your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely influenced by my musical tastes for myself.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the garbage collection -- the grass and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It was <unk> from fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the narrative stories that come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it is her choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, they accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women as economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that's ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women women color, the gay <unk> and <unk> for white women, <unk> middle class.
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist though.
It also happens to be this: <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminists <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to be <unk>
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider that <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders in the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear of what that looks like -- so that it doesn't be able to be able to do a little realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music 2014, from 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, looking at this star of the <unk> to embrace the feminism and doing the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless arguments if they were <unk> it was or not just feminist.
They made his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we want a lot to do a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question or rather, a <unk> feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give you the action and be a little more brave.
If you listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy by providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change effectively affecting their profit.
It's certainly difficult.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two little girls and <unk> <unk> and very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
It's where they were spreading through strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sport, the <unk>
We can change radio power when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies do not treat women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as sacks of <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, to participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't have enough number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or an organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they were going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help them to be even even more as even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision-making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top, people in the power of directors and movie producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more brave to create meaningful and meaningful.
We can also claim to bravery our question, well, wrong, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you, especially because I had my voice -- my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
And my voice, and after all I didn't dare to believe I could say something that might matter.
But it was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
So through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I argue the hopeful reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we could all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had been reluctant to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune system -- is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the outbreak of the <unk> outbreak were not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed debate about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the number of intelligent scientists that the theory causing autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence remained stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> fundraising markets like <unk> <unk> is referred to are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if it could another child in <unk>
So what's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control to Atlanta what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "A better <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for in the face of his son of two years, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to explain why they were so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow and slow progress in the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turns out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that looked like <unk> the private worlds that looked like <unk> their own parents, even to their own parents.
They could fun for hours by shaking their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
The bottom of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, I noticed that I had seen less than 150,000 cases of their syndrome as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis of <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine from every 10 kids sent by other doctors to her office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child childhood is caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, has kept very carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that clustering into certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite record, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they heard their parents were willing to stop their approval for.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
<unk> wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and his husband was John <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as black-eyed <unk> without special education, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Department of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
I had a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was a lot more <unk> and diverse reality.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In the way, these kids didn't fit <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did anyone didn't realize these kids before?
But then I had a reference to a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> at his own work.
There was not even an English translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he did it for her.
The document offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with video classes with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces throughout the course of life.
Instead of treating the children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's he called them their little teachers, and he helped help in the development of education methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that ranged from an amazing variety of different and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> of the <unk> culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was even beyond saying that for success in science and art, a grain of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes enter <unk> replacing the limited model of <unk> by a broad and Asperger model.
These changes not fell into <unk>
<unk> when I came from, and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world would see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, we were introduced the first very easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were actually waiting for the people that with autism and their families finally supported the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in diagnostics. A simple, powerful story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are going to solve by the new advances -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention of attention to detail.
Clearly, autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, and the parents with faith in their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all of the hands on cover to <unk> the boat.
As we move into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to allow a brain.
Thank you.
